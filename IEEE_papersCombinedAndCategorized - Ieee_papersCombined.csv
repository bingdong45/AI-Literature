"WIP: Beyond Code: Evaluating ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Meta AI as AI Tutors in Computer Science and Engineering Education",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893528/,"This Work-in-Progress research paper evaluates the validity of Large Language Models (LLMs) as conversational AI tutors for computer science learning. While current engineering education literature has predominantly emphasized the rapid evolution of LLMs as conversational AI tutors for programming languages, the exploration into their effectiveness within general STEM topics remains comparatively scarce. This WIP study thus centers on evaluating the potential of LLMs to facilitate understanding of core hardware design concepts critical to computer science and engineering (CSE) education. By cross-checking the responses from generative AI chatbots to an openended CSE-based question, we aimed to uncover how LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI, can contribute to teaching and learning of general CSE courses instead of a specifically coding-based one. Our method involved simulating a student query on the popular debate between CISC vs. RISC related to computer architecture and analyzing the chatbots' responses. This initial collection of data served as the foundation for a continual comparative analysis aimed at determining the inherent instructional value of each LLM and its validity and reliability. To systematically assess the responses, we introduced an evaluation framework focusing on metrics, such as response accuracy, persuasiveness, and depth of explanation. The current work anticipates not only enriching our understanding of how these advanced LLMs can support general CSE education but also identifying areas where further development is needed for a more holistic integration of LLM-based chatbots in assisting student comprehension in the overarching engineering education.",2: AI Tutor ,2: CS,Arnav

Personalized Learning in Automation: A 3D AI-Based Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343228/,"In today's technology-driven world, the need for interdisciplinary skills is increasing. This has become challenging in tertiary education to provide students with applicable knowledge of various fields. Anderson's Adaptive Control of Thought (ACT) theory suggests that universities have traditionally focused on imparting declarative knowledge, which involves memorization of facts and concepts. However, imparting the ability to apply such knowledge on individual students and create procedural knowledge is the challenge. This includes teachers dealing with a diverse range of student abilities, particularly at university-level where they teach the same course content to students with different levels of prior knowledge and, given the structure of modern education systems, the resources required to monitor and provide feedback for a number of decisions and attempts independently performed by the students. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have proven to be effective in addressing the aforementioned challenges by creating personalized learning environments that provide instant feedback, adapt to individual student needs, and promote the development of procedural knowledge. In the field of automation education at the university level, we are creating a 3D artificial intelligence (AI)-based ITS software named KIAAA (An AI Assistant for teaching in the field of automation), specifically designed to teach computer programming to students. KIAAA aims to assist students in transitioning from their abilities to procedural aptitude by providing personalized learning scenarios that allow them to apply their knowledge and receive immediate feedback. Our approach is based mainly on the pedagogical model of ITS, which focuses on creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment that promotes success for all students, regardless of their initial level of knowledge. One of the key aspects of our approach is the utilization of personalized learning. We propose a scheme that, subsequent to evaluate student's initial levels of procedural knowledge, creates 3D learning environments tailored to each individual student. By analyzing the solutions proposed by the students, we select the difficulty level of subsequent tasks. This approach takes into consideration student's discrete competence throughout the learning process, enabling them to progress on their prior knowledge. Additionally, the software provides customized feedback to each student on their performance, helping students identify areas that require improvement. Concepts for and implementations of ITS for a variety of fields, including introductory programming classes, have evolved for a long time. Our main contribution lies in presenting an end to end solution for ITS focused on teaching programming for automation students with realistically 3D simulated factory environments. While we strongly believe to have created a pedagogically sound, integrated intelligent teaching system for assisting programming classes in tertiary automation education, a robust user study for methodically evaluating our concept and implementation is still to be performed.

A Systematic Evaluation of Code-generating Chatbots for Use in Undergraduate Computer Science Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893165/,"This research paper focuses on evaluating code-generating chatbots. Chatbots like ChatGPT released in the past three years have proven capable of a wide variety of tasks within a conversational interaction, including writing code and answering code-related questions. With these recent advances, chatbots have many potential uses in education, including computer science education. However, before these chatbots are used in CS curricula, their capabilities and limitations must be systematically tested and understood. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of four known, open-source, code-based chatbots in programming tasks by performing a standardized study in which different chatbots are tasked with providing answers for a variety of assignments from Boise State University's computer science program. We found that while all of the chatbots can write code and provide explanations, some do better than others, and each of them work differently in conversations. Moreover, all of them suffered similar and important limitations, which has implications for adoption in curriculum. As a second experiment, we used the Llama chatbot to perform a human evaluation by enabling student novice and experienced programmers to use it as a coding assistant to complete specific tasks in a common software development environment. We found that the coding assistant can help novice programmers accomplish simple tasks in comparable time and code efficacy as more experienced programmers. Given these experiments, and given feedback from participants in our studies, we see a clear picture emerge: new programmers should learn important concepts about programming without the help of code assistants so students can (1) demonstrate their understanding of important concepts and (2) have enough experience to assess code assistant output as useful or erroneous. Then, once intermediate skills are mastered (e.g., object oriented programming and data structures), it seems appropriate to introduce students systematically to coding assistants to help with specific assignments throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum. We conclude by addressing ethical considerations for the use of code-based chatbots in computer science education and future directions of research.",2: AI Tutor ,2: CS,Arnav

The intended outcomes of SABERR are supporting and enhancing students' learning by using their mistakes as resources to improve their awareness about their own knowledge and problem-solving strategies. The application design of the SABERR assessment unfolds in three structured phases which involve a reflective process where students are asked to articulate and explain the reasoning behind their initial errors. Our preliminary findings reveal that students initially struggled with error analysis and articulating knowledge gaps. However, a structured, step-by-step process significantly enhanced their error identification and correction abilities. The SABERR assessment approach significantly shifted student behavior towards prioritizing mastery of material, which was evidenced by increased engagement in class discussions and a reduction in academic dishonesty. Students reported improved ability to detect and correct errors, with 95% acknowledging enhanced understanding of AI concepts. However, this method also increased the workload for instructors and teaching assistants. Overall, 91% of students believed that a productive attitude towards mistakes would benefit their future careers, underscoring the effectiveness of SABERR in fostering a deeper, more analytical learning process among computer science students. The findings from our pilot study emphasize that the SABERR assessment approach not only enhances students' conceptual understanding and problem-solving capabilities but also promotes metacognitive skill development.

Exploring the Potential of Locally Run Large Language (AI) Models for Automated Grading in Introductory Computer Science Courses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892816/,"This innovative practice full paper describes the effectiveness of self-hosted large language models (LLMs) in assisting with the automatic grading of CSI assignments. Educators often rely on automated review of student code submissions in larger courses. Despite recent advancements, current systems primarily focus on assessing functionality, with important aspects such as code structure, efficiency, and style often relegated to secondary foci. LLMs provide an increasingly attractive addition to these systems to enhance those overlooked areas. Prior research has shown LLM's capable of assisting students in understanding and resolving programmer error messages, correcting syntax errors, providing enhanced explanations of code segments, or even generating code. The absence of freely available, purpose-designed LLMs for grading and providing feedback on code submissions prevents widespread adoption by educators. Remotely-hosted systems, such as fine-tuned GPT models, have shown promise, yet the associated risks of privacy breaches, ethical considerations, and recurring costs make this approach unfeasible as a universal solution. To mitigate these concerns, self-hosted open-source models are an alternative that can operate on consumer-grade hardware and prevent some privacy and security concerns. While no purpose-built solution yet exists, it is unclear if any existing models are powerful enough to facilitate automated grading. To explore these questions, we present a two-phase analysis, leveraging real grading data from a semester length, introductory CSI course with 124 students and nine programming projects. Nine stable LLM models were selected and repeatedly prompted to grade student submissions using the same context that a human teaching assistant (TA) was given. This paper analyzes 1,172,383 API requests, totaling 33.4 days of active runtime, evaluating model consistency, ability to adhere to specified constraints, and comparison to human-generated grades. The results show various models' inability to consistently grade assignments, albeit with some exceptions. The importance of providing comprehensive context to models was highlighted, as incomplete contexts resulted in worse performance. Other models struggled with longer prompts, delivering less consistent results. Despite disparities between AI-generated and human-assigned grades, the potential for refinement is clear; improved rubrics or selective fine-tuning could enhance model output. Future work will focus on analyzing models' qualitative justifications for grades, refining rubrics, training on domain-specific datasets, and fine-tuning the highest performing models to potentially improve grading accuracy.",,,

Using Chat-GPT to Create Multiple Choice CS Exams,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893096/,"This work in progress Innovative Practice paper presents our work evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized to aid in the development of scalable and authentic programming exam questions for students in upper-division courses. Traditionally, students' understanding of computing concepts are often verified using written exams. This is especially the case in larger universities due to their overall enrollment sizes, making more authentic, involved assignments particularly hard to facilitate. Since the rise of Chat-GPT and other LLMs, the use of such exams has seen a resurgence in popularity in classrooms globally. Fears have recently grown that programming assignments, particularly those that are take home assignments, are not adequate assessments of students' understanding given the ease at which students can use LLMs such as Chat-GPT to obtain answers. multiple-choice exams have been a traditionally popular programming exam format, where-in students are required to choose the correct answer to a prompt or the segment of code that best fits within a larger block of code. Another form of exam question that has been traditionally popular is providing students with blocks of code and ask students to either interpret the code's meaning or find the errors in the code. Both of these styles of assignments provide opportunities for students to demonstrate a deep understanding of code syntax and structure, while also tasking them to demonstrate their understanding of what the intended purpose of the code is. However, the development of these exam problems has traditionally required a substantial amount of work for instructors and teaching assistants to develop. Our goal with this work was to determine if LLMs represent effective tools for developing exam questions. Additionally, we wanted to see if LLMs could effectively design problems based on learning outcomes, allowing the instructor to become the evaluator of the exam questions rather than the original author. Our motivation for this was to develop a reproducible and easier to implement methodology for developing exams at scale for instructors while alleviating the workload imposed on instructors during the development of exams. Our initial research has indicated the use of these LLMs for exam problem generation greatly reduces the workload for instructors while allowing for the creation of far richer programming questions for students that require them to apply more of their knowledge to individual problems. We have had a good amount of success in developing these problems for upper-division courses, as well as introductory-level courses. This work represents initial steps towards the use of these LLMs for generating exams and more work is needed to determine the actual efficacy and long-term benefits and reliability of these tools. Regardless, we are confident that LLMs in their current form represent incredibly powerful tools for instructors to utilize in the development of their course exams.",1: Somewhat AI related,2: CS,

Augmenting Virtual Labs with Artificial Intelligence for Hybrid Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10578649/,"The shift towards online learning through websites has been instrumental in enhancing accessibility. However, while virtual labs have been promising in generating interactive simulations of science experiments, they fall short in delivering the dynamic and immersive experiences essential for effective learning, especially in computing education courses. Recognizing this challenge, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into virtual labs emerges as a promising solution to aid student learning. AI-augmented virtual labs can simulate real-world scenarios, providing students with hands-on experiences in a controlled and safe environment. This work explores the impact on student learning (with focus on user engagement, skill development, comprehension, retention, and overall experience) when integrating a virtual labs module with and without AI support. Student perspectives on the effectiveness and satisfaction with the learning modules were collected using surveys that probe not only the perceived improvement in learning outcomes, but also the subjective user experience and engagement levels. Additionally, user performance indicators, based on assessments/evaluations and discussions (within the virtual labs, with and without AI integration), serve as a measure of the students' skills development, comprehension, and knowledge retention. This approach provides an objective metric to evaluate the efficacy of each learning approach. Based on data from surveys, performance indicators, and feedback analysis, the study aims to draw comprehensive conclusions and suggest potential avenues of further inquiry, regarding the effectiveness of integrating virtual labs both with AI. This integration not only enhances the learning experience, but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students. This innovative approach offers a distinctive combination of interactivity, adaptability, and versatility. The goal of this study is not to argue for AI supported virtual lab-based learning approaches, but rather, to give empirical information about its usefulness. The findings of this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion on innovative educational practices by providing useful insights into the possible benefits and challenges of adopting hybrid learning approaches powered by AI.",,,

The Impact of Chatbots on Students' Reflective Thinking in Introductory Programming Course,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016417/,"This study investigated New Zealand students' views on utilising chatbots and the impact of using ChatGPT or similar chatbots with suggested prompts on the reflective thinking skills of university students. The research was conducted in an introductory computer programming course (COMP102) in the School of Engineering and Computer Science. This introductory course uses a flipped classroom approach. The students were introduced to an approach to use a generative AI-based chatbot as an intervention. The intervention consisted of a brief explanation of chatbot training and utilisation, along with a specifically designed prompt intended to support learning. An example of prompt usage was demonstrated. Students' feedback was collected through two instruments: a Reflective Thinking Scale questionnaire, which measured students' reflective thinking abilities, and an open-ended student guide questionnaire designed to gather qualitative insights into their views and experiences using chatbots. Employing a mixed-methods research approach, we incorporated quantitative (Reflective Thinking Scale questionnaire) and qualitative (open-ended student guide questionnaire) data collection instruments within an experimental pre-test and post-test control group design. The pretest yielded 86 completed responses, while the post-test had 49 participants out of over 400 students enrolled in the course. The pre-test and posttest results did not yield quantitatively significant results in students' reflective thinking after the intervention. However, 21 out of 29 qualitative post-test respondents who utilise chatbots indicated that their interactions with the chatbot showed evidence of reflective thinking that improved their learning processes. The results revealed that students initially had doubts about using a chatbot for their learning, as they felt it might hinder their learning process or be unnecessary. Students perceived chatbots to be unreliable due to providing wrong answers, inaccurate code snippets, hallucinations, and plagiarised content. Therefore, students preferred to be self-reliant and not dependent on chatbots. Following the intervention, students demonstrated an increase of confidence in utilising chatbots as a learning tool, especially those who also used the suggested prompt. Students found that chatbots and the suggested prompt could be used to support learning and not only to provide answers. The chatbot was beneficial as a learning tool, providing additional information to clarify their understanding and reasoning behind providing simple explanations of programming concepts. Future work will focus on an intervention study in a more controlled environment to isolate the features of generative AI tools' impact and minimise external factors.",,,

ZPD a concept introduced by Lev Vygotsky during the late 1920's, stands on the premise that the distance between actual development level (independence) and the level of potential development (dependence) lies in mentorship by adult guidance and peer collaboration. Several social-cultural theories have utilized this to analyze the relationship between instructor and learner achievement. The idea is to influence the learner's knowledge zone by active and productive interaction. It has been noted that when learners are given the opportunity to collaborate it not only motivates the learner but also influences their sociological development and this helps to bolster their already established knowledge. However, the role of AI on the ZPD of the learner creates a dichotomy that needs further exploration. A ubiquitous AI educational setting may encourage learners to remain passive rather than foster participatory behaviour and positive outcome.

Currently, the topic of AI does not appear in most STEM curriculums not only because of the necessary technological infrastructure but also because of the required mathematical background. This paper is an attempt to develop AI in the STEM education framework through interactive activities. Our project titled “Adventure Alongside AI” or “A3I” analyzes the actions of students and reacts with sounds and visuals to illustrate the basic capabilities of AI. The developed platform could target different age groups of students: for younger students, this activity would serve as a motivational tool to discuss AI, and for older students, this activity would serve as an introduction into basic AI development and implementation. Our design platform aims to build upon existing educational constructs by combining the topics of AI and STEM education with gamification. Through this integration, educators can introduce new ways of creative problem-solving using enjoyable, interactive activities with AI. We assessed the design platform with a group of students through a survey that gauged their understanding of the AI embedded in the “A3I” game activity; the results showed that the majority of students are interested in using this technology more in their classroom.",,,
An Intelligent Tutoring System to Support Code Maintainability Skill Development,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902566/,"Software engineers are tasked with writing functionally correct code of high quality. Maintainability is a crucial code quality attribute that determines the ease of analyzing, modifying, reusing, and testing a software component.

FedLMA: A Federated Learning Framework Integrating LLM-Based Multi-Agent Reasoning With Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11154048/,"Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) applications encounter issues with data distribution bias, privacy and security concerns, and resource constraints, especially in consumer-centric scenarios. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed, privacy-preserving paradigm that enables multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared model using only their own local data. However, conventional FL methods often suffer from client drift induced by non-IID data across participants, resulting in slower convergence and degraded overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose FedLMA, a fully decentralized framework that combines local knowledge distillation with an LLM-driven multi-agent reasoning mechanism over a blockchain-enabled knowledge-sharing layer. Specifically, FedLMA first extracts and regularizes soft labels from each client’s local model to generate robust distilled knowledge. Then, a large language model driven multi-agent system evaluates class-wise learning difficulty and knowledge retention to form a personalized demand vector, which is used to adaptively filter and weight relevant knowledge fragments. Finally, the selected knowledge guides student model updates via a hybrid cross-entropy and KL-divergence loss.

This paper describes a train-the-trainer programme that was designed to enhance early-career researchers’ ability to deliver training based on their research. The programme was delivered to a pilot group who then delivered training to external stakeholders on two occasions. The train-the-trainer programme was then evaluated from the perspectives of the trained early-career researchers along with the participants who subsequently took part in workshops delivered by this cohort. Results indicate that the programme was largely successful in improving the early-career researchers’ confidence with respect to training delivery, while also creating a positive learning experience for the participants. The paper concludes with a discussion around the future plans for the development of the train-the-trainer programme based on the results from this pilot implementation.",,,
Integrating Generative AI with Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis Course Homework,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892822/,"This innovative practice full paper describes how to integrate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis (CS2) homework at Oklahoma State University.

How Challenges Become Opportunities: Micro-credentials and Artificial Intelligence,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016509/,"As we move from the Information Age to the Intelligence Age, universities must redefine themselves taking into account recent challenges. Two of these challenges are Micro-credentials and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Micro-credentials certify the learning outcomes of short-term learning experiences, which are typically more flexible and tailored to specific, job-relevant skills, meeting the increasing demand for continuous education. These learning experiences are normally referred to as micro-credential courses or micro-credential programs and disrupt traditional degree models. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is disrupting every single aspect of our life and work. Artificial Intelligence tools can work as assistants helping in all kinds of tasks that were previously reserved for humans. Artificial Intelligence can be used in education in many ways, such as to create personalized learning paths, create and optimize educational multimedia content such as text, voice, image, or video, tutor students, and monitor student progress in real-time, contributing to the acquisition of learning outcomes. Putting the two challenges together, Artificial Intelligence can also contribute to generate micro-credentials by ensuring learners demonstrate competence in practical, job-specific skills, enhancing their credibility for employers. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence can playa pivotal role in advancing micro-credential courses and programs, helping universities redefine their offerings to provide personalized, adaptable, and industry-relevant learning experiences. Artificial Intelligence can help in designing the content and the learning experience as with courses in general, but it can also help in designing the specificities of micro-credential courses. The specific “skills” provided by Artificial Intelligence for defining micro-credentials range from clerical work related to mastering formats such as ELM or OpenBadges that are needed to construct digital credentials to creative sug-gestions that aid in designing the details of the micro-credential course. Alternatively, the micro-credentials designed can include topics about Artificial Intelligence, helping the workforce on this important area. This paper analyzes the interplay of these two challenges and how they can help each other, making opportunities out of challenges.",,,

Enhancing the Intelligence of the Adaptive Learning Software through an AI assisted Data Analytics on Students Learning Attributes with Unequal Weight,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9637387/,"Along with the growing popularity of the adaptive learning platform software in STEM education programs, further enhancing the ability of the adaptive learning platform to support learning effectiveness has become a priority. A common goal of all the adaptive learning platform software is to identify gaps in a student's knowledge, and provide relevant learning materials based on the result of the assessment of the student's exiting knowledge towards to the targeted subject, to increase the learning effectiveness. However, the student's existing knowledge is only one learning attribute, and it cannot reflect all the aspects that have an impact to the student's learning effectiveness. A natural solution to overcome this weakness is to make the adaptive learning decision making algorithm capable to process the dataset of multiple learning attributes of the student efficiently. This paper presents a machine learning algorithm to efficiently process the dataset of a student's multiple learning attributes. The main enabling foundation for this new algorithm is a data structure called “student learning attributes index” which represents every learning attribute as a tuple of three elements: the “learning-attribute-If)”, the “weight” of the learning attribute among all the learning attributes, and the “efficiency” of the contribution to the student's learning effectiveness made by the learning attribute.

Moreover, the PEFT approach significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters within the LLMs by over 300 times and decreased their training duration. Although the training time for PEFT-tuned LLMs was still longer than that required for fully fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa, these LLMs demonstrated specialization in this specific dimension and generalizability to other tasks and contexts.

Stimulating Brainstorming Activities with Generative AI in Higher Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016340/,"Developing teamwork skills and creativity is becoming increasingly important in higher education. Brainstorming activities can support the acquisition of such transversal skills by encouraging open dialogue in collaborative design processes. In a successful brainstorming, participants propose diverse ideas, combine them, and elaborate new propositions by taking inspiration in the propositions of their teammates. However, the cognitive effect of idea fixation may hinder this process. Idea fixations happens when participants focus on a limited set of ideas and are unable to think about unrelated alternatives. This effect lowers the creativity of the group and prevents the participants to consider diverse aspects of the problem at hand, which is an important mechanism in design-based learning. Leveraging the recent development in Large Language Models (LLM), we propose to integrate a Generative-AI agent to introduce new ideas into a brainstorming process supported by a digital application. Such agent can be designed to bring new topics to be considered that the students may not have brought up themselves. Our study aims to examine how such AI-generated ideas may influence the ideas proposed anonymously by the participants, and ultimately, the outcome of the activity. We use a quasi-experimental design with two conditions: one in which only the students generate ideas (control), another where they receive AI-generated ideas along with their own. We conduct this experiment as a part of a design thinking project carried out by computer science students. Using a qualitative coding combined with Epistemic Network Analysis, we investigate the dissemination of the topics brought by the Generative-AI agent within the ideas of the participants. We also present and discuss practical aspects of the intervention and its implementation by educators in their teaching. Our findings are contributing to the understanding of humanAI interactions in the context of collaborative ideation in educational settings. They can inform the design of new interaction mechanisms with AI agents to support creativity. Furthermore, by introducing previously unconsidered topics to these activities, these AI-based agents can support groups of students in considering a wider range of aspects of the matter at hand, supporting the development of critical thinking. These mechanisms may be useful to educators and facilitators looking for solutions to overcome idea fixation and increase creativity in brainstorming.",,,

Eighty (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n = 80$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) CS1 students completed six debugging tasks using a within-subjects study design that ensured each participant saw each of the three error message styles twice. We measured time-to-fix, number of code reruns, task failure rate, and then asked for students’ preferences. Participants were found to resolve errors significantly faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o messages, but, like prior work, we could not find a statistically significant difference between the baseline GPT-4o and traditional Python error messages. Error message style had no effect on number of reruns and task failures; however, the particular debugging task had a significant difference on both. Despite solving problems faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o model, participants preferred the baseline GPT-4o output (similar to unmodified ChatGPT).

This study first examines the low-speed inference problem of the deep learning model. A fast inference algorithm is proposed for the model, which achieves a speedup of eighty times. This study further explores integrating a human–machine collaborative learning process with the deep learning agent. Students were surveyed about their perceptions of the agent in supporting learning. Student responses are interpreted within the learning partnerships model (LPM) framework to show how the agent's technical automation and autonomy features support student-agent learning partnerships. Finally, implications and suggestions for educational application and research of deep learning technology are presented.",,,
Toward AI Evaluation of Student Essays,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11132037/,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching practices has expanded rapidly, and there is increasing discussion about computer-assisted assessment. This study investigates the application of AI for evaluating student essays, focusing on a Software Testing course at Tampere University. Traditionally, on this course essays are assessed manually by teaching assistants using predefined evaluation criteria. This research explores the feasibility of automating the evaluation process by comparing assessments generated by AI models—OpenAI's large language models (LLM) API—with human evaluations. The study focuses on the research question: Can automated assessment replace human evaluation? The key stages in this study include selecting a suitable AI model, its implementation and configuration, and designing an automated assessment workflow that aligns with human evaluation. The results indicate that, while AI models can evaluate at a level comparable to humans, current language models have limitations, such as consistency issues and an inability to interpret context. The findings of this study suggest that AI can be used as complementary tools rather than fully replacing humans. This work highlights the potential of AI in educational assessment while acknowledging the need for further refinement in model performance. Future directions include exploring open-source models and addressing the technical challenges related to resource requirements.",,,
Evaluation of Enhanced Programming Error Messages Generated by Large Language Models from Instructors' Point of View,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016595/,"Enhanced Programming Error Messages are one type of feedback that may be useful during the learning process of novice programmers. One way to improve such messages is by using the context given by an auto-grader from students' errors when solving programming exercises in those environments. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) may be used to provide additional feedback beyond simple compiler or interpreter error messages by garnering input from a programming exercise description, the student's code to solve that exercise, and the error generated by a Python interpreter and generating an LLM prompt from that given information. In an experiment, we asked instructors to evaluate the prompt text generated by an LLM from a variety of exercises and the students' errors. Our results show a high rate of adequate feedback by means of explanations and code examples to fix the errors without providing a full code solution. However, some cons have also been noticed, such as vague explanations, hallucinations, and dissociation from explanations and examples. The results suggest that LLM feedback is a promising approach to provide feedback to novice programmers by means of enhanced programming error messages.",,,
Analyzing the Impact of Big Data on Curriculum Design and Student Performance in Secondary Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032025/,"Bigchanges are happening in the Education Sector particularly with Big Data Analytics in the digital era. The first Big Data study that investigates how big data influences curriculum development and performance of students in the context of secondary level education, and explores the significance of data-driven approaches in revolutionizing the pedagogical practices and performance of learners. Big data - a huge amount of structured and unstructured information - reveals insights about student behaviors, learning patterns, educational success, and social-emotional growth. When appropriately leveraged, this data enables educators and policymakers alike to develop adaptable curricula that supports diverse learners, and encourages personalized and equitable learning experiences. It delves in to the data drawn from myriad sources - digital learning platforms, student information systems, attendance data, assessments, social media, behavioral tracking tools. With predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, educators can identify student strengths, weaknesses, and learning gaps in real time. This allows for timely interventions, differentiated instruction, and personalized learning experiences, leading to improved academic performance and greater engagement. The constant collection of data also enables a feedback loop dynamic, in which the contents of the curriculum can be revised and better adapted to fit both the subjects that are a mesh of future job market skills, as well as the skills laid out by the Casper Libero students. In addition to sizing up big data, the paper explores how it supports evidence-informed decision making in curriculum design. If used in the right way, educational institutes would have been using AI to collect historical and real-time data and search for the best teaching approaches/content delivery models for different cohorts of students. It provides perspective on how to transition toward a non-customized approach to curriculum that is adaptable, dynamic, and cultivates critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills in students. And some also include how data analytics has uncovered trends that may have been previously unrecognized around dropout rates and absenteeism and even student mental health, allowing schools to take proactive steps to foster the overall well-being and retention of students. Although the implementation of Big Data in secondary education brings many advantages, this article critically assesses some potential downsides and ethical dilemmas.",,,

An Intelligent Tool for Combatting Contract Cheating Behaviour by Facilitating Scalable Student-Tutor Discussions,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9270293/,"With the global increase in demand for online tertiary education, teachers are facing unique challenges in scaling assessment activities and meaningful student engagement. One such aspect is contract cheating behaviours exhibited in the modern online environment - posing a threat to the academic integrity of tertiary education. These obstacles amplify when applied to traditionally difficult domains like introductory programming education. Prior research on contract cheating identification proposes that while challenging, techniques such as developing strong teacher-student relationships, and real-time discussions may lead to instances of identifying contract cheating behaviours. The proposition, then, is to scale real-time, student-teacher discussions with large, online cohorts - similar to those discussions which traditionally took place in the classroom.

A Teaching Effect Feedback Platform Combined with Convolutional Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935443/,"At present, the rapid development of information technology has promoted the diversification of education methods. Online education, as an important supplement to traditional education and an important means of education reform, has become an integral part of the education and teaching process. However, the long-term development of online education still faces many problems, such as difficulties in grasping students' classroom learning states, poor interaction between teachers and students, and difficulty in ensuring the teaching effect. Thanks to the development of deep learning technology and the availability of large-scale facial expression databases, significant progress has been made in the field of facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a teaching platform combined with artificial intelligence. This platform uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to recognize students' classroom behavior, specifically their facial expressions, to analyze their learning states and provide timely feedback on classroom teaching effects. The platform can also read video, use advanced image processing and pattern recognition to find expressions and gestures in the video, and mark them, thereby recognizing students' classroom statuses and monitoring their listening statuses. This platform can also generate student behavior reports and visual statistical charts to help teachers better understand students' learning situations and progress, provide teachers with accurate and real-time teaching feedback, help teachers adjust teaching strategies and methods, and improve teaching quality. Finally, after the preliminary test, it is confirmed that the platform has met the initial design requirements and has high identification accuracy and strong data analysis abilities.",,,

AI-Driven CASGN Framework for Evaluating Descriptive Answers in Online Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910723/,"There is an enormous demand for automated assessment systems, which can handle the bulk assessments efficiently and effectively. While existing systems perform well in grading objective questions, they break down with subjective or descriptive answers that require a deeper analysis of context and understanding. To address this challenge, we have proposed the AI-Enhanced Context-Aware Semantic Grading Network-state-of-the-art algorithm for instant auto-descriptive response scoring in e-assessments. The AI-CASGN utilizes state-of-the-art AI technologies, particularly NLP and deep learning models-very specifically transformer architectures-during context-based semantic analysis. Beyond mere keyword matching, the system scores what students say and how relevant it is. This takes the concept of grading to an even more fine-tuned art. Scores change with depth and accuracy in the answer given to show complete evaluation. With the dynamic grading framework, adaptation on scores both regarding the accuracy and depth of the answer for a precise evaluation is possible. Inbuilt adaptive learning within the system performance evolves day by day by learning from the new data. AI-CASGN is designed to handle biases in mitigation by considering that there may be different patterns for a response to ensure that responses with varied wording but conceptually correct are fairly graded. It will have to deal with the volumes at scale, hence it is envisaged to process large volumes of responses in minimum time and with high accuracy to be deployed in real time in any educational institution. In future, the system will also provide personalized feedback to students for the purpose of continuous learning and improvement. This represents a scalable, real-time, unbiased tool that assesses subjective answers in modern online learning environments.",,,

These LLM-based AI could analyze the content of artefacts produced in formative verbal and written tasks, ensuring that the students include relevant information in their report, and the report requirements such as structure, grammar, style, mechanics etc. are met. The models were also used to analyze the meeting transcripts of student teams, thus allowing the teamwork process and contributions from each member of the student team to be monitored closely. The integration of LLM-based pre-trained AI increased the timeliness and effectiveness of formative feedback on students' design and teamwork processes, thereby fostering a more adaptive and personalized learning experience. Any missteps or misunderstandings on the part of the students regarding the task requirements, as well as any issues arising within team interactions can be promptly communicated to the instructor for immediate resolution. While LLM-based pre-trained AI holds significant promise in transforming feedback practice, it is important to acknowledge that there are still limitations and barriers to practical implementation in the classroom. The feedback produced by LLM-based pre-trained AI lacks nuanced contextual understanding. The integration of LLM-based pre-trained AI into feedback practices holds transformative potential for education. On one hand, the models offer the promise of responsive and personalized learning, and the potential to foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills through interactive and adaptive learning platforms. Conversely, the reliability of the models as a feedback tool and students' receptions to their use remains ambiguous. We conclude the paper by proposing some strategies to overcome these limitations and support academics in applying LLM-based pre-trained AI in feedback practice.",,,

For this purpose, corresponding lecture recordings were transcribed and made available to the Large Language Model GPT-4 as external knowledge source together with timestamps as metainformation by using RAG. The purpose of this is to prevent hallucinations and to enforce the use of the technical terms and phrases from the lecture. In an exercise platform developed to solve programming problems for an introductory programming lecture, students can request feedback on their solutions generated by GPT-4. For this task GPT-4 receives the students' code solution, the compiler output, the result of unit tests and the relevant passages from the lecture notes available through the use of RAG as additional context. The feedback generated by GPT-4 should guide students to solve problems independently and link to the lecture content, using the time stamps of the transcript as meta-information. In this way, the corresponding lecture videos can be viewed immediately at the corresponding positions. For the evaluation, students worked with the tool in a workshop and decided for each feedback whether it should be extended by RAG or not.

FastFixer: An Efficient and Effective Approach for Repairing Programming Assignments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765070/,"Providing personalized and timely feedback for student’s programming assignments is useful for programming education. Automated program repair (APR) techniques have been used to fix the bugs in programming assignments, where the Large Language Models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results.

Automatic Unit Test Generation for Programming Assignments Using Large Language Models,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024401/,"Programming knowledge is a crucial aspect of computer science education, and unit testing is commonly employed to automatically assess programming assignments. Instructors and teaching assistants typically invest considerable efforts in writing unit tests, which may still be vulnerable to human oversight and mistakes. In this work, we explored the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the assessment of programming assignments. In particular, we proposed two approaches: the plain approach that uses GPT-4o-mini in a vanilla setting, and the augmented approach that integrates additional strategies such as tailored prompts with syntax and semantic constraints, and a feedback mechanism with information on test-effectiveness metrics. We evaluate the two approaches on six real-world programming assignments from an introductory-level programming course at our university. Compared to the plain approach, the augmented approach improves the usability and effectiveness of the generated unit tests, reducing 85 % compilation errors while enhancing the statement coverage and mutation scores by 1.7 x and 2.1 x, respectively. In addition, the augmented approach also complements human-written tests by covering additional program behaviors. In a case study of 1296 students' submissions that pass human-written tests, the augmented approach successfully detected new bugs in 13 % submissions, with an accuracy of 27 %. These results not only demonstrate the potentials of LLMs in generating useful unit tests for programming assignments, but also highlight the strategies that can effectively enhance LLMs' capabilities to augment human-written tests, offering practical benefits for both educators and students.",,,

Identifying Student Profiles Within Online Judge Systems Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024788/,"Online Judge (OJ) systems are typically considered within programming-related courses as they yield fast and objective assessments of the code developed by the students. Such an evaluation generally provides a single decision based on a rubric, most commonly whether the submission successfully accomplished the assignment. Nevertheless, since in an educational context such information may be deemed insufficient, it would be beneficial for both the student and the instructor to receive additional feedback about the overall development of the task. This work aims to tackle this limitation by considering the further exploitation of the information gathered by the OJ and automatically inferring feedback for both the student and the instructor. More precisely, we consider the use of learning-based schemes—particularly, multi-instance learning (MIL) and classical machine learning formulations—to model student behavior. Besides, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is contemplated to provide human-understandable feedback. The proposal has been evaluated considering a case of study comprising 2500 submissions from roughly 90 different students from a programming-related course in a computer science degree. The results obtained validate the proposal: The model is capable of significantly predicting the user outcome (either passing or failing the assignment) solely based on the behavioral pattern inferred by the submissions provided to the OJ. Moreover, the proposal is able to identify prone-to-fail student groups and profiles as well as other relevant information, which eventually serves as feedback to both the student and the instructor.",,,

A Proposal of Adaptive Learning System for Object-Oriented Programming Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893496/,"This paper presents an Adaptive Learning (AL) system for teaching Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The OOP paradigm is one of the foundations for introductory programming education, being one of the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Computing Curricula's Programming Languages Fundamentals. However, studies show that students have difficulty associating abstract concepts with real-world analogies. When trying to solve a problem, the difficulty in understanding and applying concepts can hinder using the paradigm. Therefore, it is necessary to create alternatives to assist in teaching Object-Oriented Programming. One solution is to use Adaptive Learning, which aims to adjust the knowledge acquisition process according to the student. Learning Objects (LO), which can be games, quizzes, interactive experiences, videos, and images, among others, can be used to support this method. Thus, this work aims to present a proposal for an approach to teaching OOP using Adaptive Learning. The approach consists of a support system for OOP students, which will support their teaching with a Learning Object recommendation mechanism that is more relevant to the student's learning style. To this end, agents will be used to control the selection of LOs and adjust the profiles. The student's actions will be collected and used as a basis for the recommendation. From the data obtained, constant adjustments will be made to the recommendation of LOs and the student's profile, thus providing more suitable content for their learning. As a result of this study, a functional prototype of the recommendation method was developed in a mobile application. The use of this application will be evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to validate the solution. After using the application, the evaluation results will provide us with information about the users' perception of the proposal, its recommendation accuracy, and usability. With this, we can build a version that will be used in the classroom and contribute to the student's OOP learning process.",,,
Remediation of Mathematics Knowledge in Engineering Students Through an AI-Based Selfstudy Educational Intervention,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016455/,"This study addresses the remediation of mathematical knowledge in engineering education, a critical issue as many students lack foundational skills upon entering essential courses. We conducted a quasi-experimental study that compared traditional instruction methods with a self-study strategy across three phases: diagnosing initial knowledge, providing tailored self-study resources to an experimental group, and assessing the effectiveness of the intervention. During the first period of the Fall 2024 semester, an initial diagnostic test on key mathematical topics was administered via CANVAS in a first-year Engineering and Sciences course. The experimental group received CANVAS instructional videos, supplementary documents, and access to the AI tool Jungle for optional self-study. In contrast, the control group had access to voluntary tutoring sessions. Post-intervention, both groups completed a final exam to measure improvements in problemsolving abilities. Additionally, a follow-up survey gathered feedback on self-study materials and Jungle. The analysis shows a positive correlation between Jungle usage and academic improvement. Jungle users initially scored slightly lower, saw greater improvements, and achieved higher post-test and final scores. The experimental group of Jungle users showed a statistically significant score improvement over the control group (<tex xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">$p=0.05$</tex>).

A Review of Ethical Considerations in Using Artificial Intelligence in E-Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493100/,"The implementation of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) is in the spotlight due to being the most substantial advancement of the century. But, despite being beneficial to e-learning, AI has imposed ethical risks and challenges that need to be addressed. Hence, we aim to present a literature review concerning ethical considerations in using AI in e-learning. In this regard, we restored all relevant articles from 5 databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of science and Eric) based on PRISMA guidelines and predefined inclusion criteria, from January 2013 till June 2023. Each reviewer conducted the process of selecting studies and extracting data, which was then synthesized using a narrative method. Initially, 169 articles were identified through the search, with 38 articles meeting the predetermined inclusion criteria for data analysis. The majority of these articles centered on a broad discourse concerning ethics and artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, in most retrieved studies, there was a limited examination of ethical considerations regarding using AI in e-learning. Among them, respecting human rights, privacy, equity and fairness, trust and accountability, transparency; enhancing learning outcomes through surveillance of learners' performance and their learning process; providing equal opportunities to have access to technologies, and avoiding any discrimination and bias were the main ethical considerations regarding using AI in e-learning. We have explained a set of general principles and ethical considerations related to the application of AI in e-learning that can assist in designing new autonomous systems and also help to consider ethical concerns when integrating AI in online educational settings.

Personalized Federated Learning based on Knowledge Distillation using Teacher Assistants,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10581694/,"Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, the heterogeneity of data among clients leads to the shared global model obtained after training being unable to adapt to the distribution of each client's dataset, resulting in a decrease in model performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a personalized federated learning method based on teacher assistant knowledge distillation-pFedCo- TA. This method clusters clients based on the similarity of distribution information of the datasets uploaded by different clients before training. By clustering clients, those with similar data distributions are grouped into a class, an assistant is appointed, and then knowledge distillation is performed between teacher-assistant and assistant-student to compress the model based on knowledge extraction, reducing communication costs, and improving the accuracy of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data through the assistant's intermediate layer. This method effectively alleviates these bottlenecks and improves the performance gap of non-IID data models. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments on different data heterogeneous scenarios on two datasets. Compared to single-model algorithms, pFedCo- TA achieves an average accuracy improvement of 27.1 % and 12.49% over FedAvg and FedProx, respectively; compared to typical personalized algorithms, pFedCo-TA's accuracy is on average 6.7% higher than FedMD.",,,

LLM-Assisted Knowledge Graph Completion for Curriculum and Domain Modelling in Personalized Higher Education Recommendations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016377/,"While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.",,,
Beyond Visuals and Audio: The Role of Olfactory Feedback in Enhancing Immersive Learning Experiences and Reducing Cognitive Load,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091955/,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology has shown its potential in education. Nonetheless, previous IVR applications have primarily focused on visual and auditory simulations, neglecting olfaction, which has limited the authenticity of the experience.

A Metalearning Approach to Personalized Automatic Assessment of Rectilinear Sketches,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9637255/,"Sketchtivity is a stylus-based intelligent tutoring system that can help instructors automatically provide feedback to their students, saving them the time and effort of providing personalized feedback themselves. The system uses a generic evaluation of perspective, direction, and accuracy to give students feedback on the quality of their sketches. If instructors want to personalize the metrics, the system would require them to provide multiple sets of samples. Therefore, instructors may use instructional team members such as teaching and graduate teaching assistants to provide feedback on the required samples. Compared to that of assistants, the feedback they produce might vary due to expertise and create noise in the training data. To address this problem, we implement a deep neural network that leverages learning to reweight algorithms. The data collected by the instructor from undergraduate and graduate-level rectilinear perspectives sketching is considered the validated sample. In this study, we analyzed the training size requirement for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to accurately predict whether or not a stroke was a perspective stroke. We observed that the training data required to predict stroke accuracy is small. In addition, the performance of the algorithm in terms of accuracy was good even under extreme conditions such as having highly unbalanced data and having a small valid set of data. The results from the study support the use of these types of algorithms for future system personalizing to support scalable feedback systems in education.",,,

Authentic Assessment Design for Meeting the Challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343376/,"Authentic Assessments are generally seen as alternate to traditional assessments though the scope of an authentic assessment is much larger than that of a traditional assessment. Authentic assessments help students in comprehending the subject matter and, if properly designed, can also ensure student workplace readiness. During the authentic assessment design, five most important aspects are considered and their incorporation is sought. These aspects include; the assessment objectives, the physical context of an assessment, the social context, the outcome of the assessment and the assessment criteria. Emergence of the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) supported applications and the Large Language Model (LLM) tools has posed new challenges to the authentic assessment design. Student access to these new applications and tools has also changed the socio-technological realities of the Learning and Teaching (L&T) practices. Therefore, we need to reimagine both, the L&T practices and the design and execution of authentic assessments. Keeping the prevailing socio-technological context in perspective, this work in progress paper proposes extending the scope of authentic assessments. The aim is to use them for quelling the growing problem of plagiarism as plagiarism can be facilitated by the use of GAI and LLM tools. Instead of considering authentic assessments as merely ‘an alternate to the traditional examination’ or ‘a tool for evaluating student workplace readiness,’ we propose adding ‘GAI redundancy’ to the scope of authentic assessments. For incorporating GAI redundancy we propose using either the game-based learning environment or a simulation environment. These two environments can be used for generating ‘close to real life’ problem-solving scenarios while assessing student comprehension and workplace readiness. In order to help practitioners, this paper also presents two examples of authentic assessments that were developed for combating plagiarism vis-à-vis enhancing student learning and evaluating their workplace readiness. In the first example, we show how to use a game environment and in the second example we demonstrate use of a simulation environment. The two examples also show how course contents can be embedded and how GAI redundancy can be incorporated in authentic assessments. The reported teaching assessment data and student feedback suggest that the proposed authentic assessment design and implementation strategies were able to engage students, help their comprehension and evaluate their workforce readiness.",,,

A Generic AI-Based Technique for Assessing Student Performance in Conducting Online Virtual and Remote Controlled Laboratories,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9973300/,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of educational technology, e-learning has become essential in the educational process. However, the adoption of e-learning in sectors such as engineering, science, and technology faces a particular challenge as it needs a special Laboratory Learning Management System (LLMS) capable of supporting online lab activities through virtual and controlled remote labs. One of the most challenging tasks in designing such LLMS is how to assess a student’s performance while an experiment is being conducted and how stuttering students can be automatically detected while experimenting and providing the appropriate assistance.

Teaching Well-Structured Code: A Literature Review of Instructional Approaches,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024456/,"Teaching the software engineers of the future to write high-quality code with good style and structure is important. This systematic literature review identifies existing instructional approaches, their objectives, and the strategies used for measuring their effectiveness. Building on an existing mapping study of code quality in education, we identified 53 papers on code structure instruction. We classified these studies into three categories: (1) studies focused on developing or evaluating automated tools and their usage (e.g., code analyzers, tutors, and refactoring tools), (2) studies discussing other instructional materials, such as learning resources (e.g., refactoring lessons and activities), rubrics, and catalogs of violations, and (3) studies discussing how to integrate code structure into the curriculum through a holistic approach to course design to support code quality. While most approaches use analyzers that point students to problems in their code, incorporating these tools into classrooms is not straightforward. Combined with further research on code structure instruction in the classroom, we call for more studies on effectiveness. Over 40% of instructional studies had no evaluation. Many studies show promise for their interventions by demonstrating improvement in student performance (e.g., reduced violations in student code when using the intervention compared with code that was written without access to the intervention). These interventions warrant further investigation on learning, to see how students apply their knowledge after the instructional supports are removed.",,,

II. Scope in Negative Sentiments: With 16% of comments being pessimistic, there is a clear opportunity for targeted improvements, emphasizing the faculty's commitment to an equitable educational experience for all students. III. Understanding Unclassified Comments: About 15% of the comments were not readily classifiable by NLP tools, which is a typical outcome in studies of this nature. These comments often consisted of non-informative inputs such as single characters, punctuation marks, or brief notes of thanks. This reflects a common occurrence in feedback collection rather than a limitation of the NLP tools used. IV. The Undercurrents of Neutral Sentiments: A significant portion of feedback was neutral, identifying areas for nuanced enhancements that could profoundly impact student satisfaction across various demographics. Our findings highlight the critical role of NLP in analyzing and interpreting large-scale student feedback, which is essential for promoting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive academic setting. These insights are invaluable for institutions aiming to align with Society 5.0's goals by improving educational quality and enhancing student experiences.

Students’ Experiences of Using ChatGPT in an Undergraduate Programming Course,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478015/,"Increasing use of artificial intelligence tools in programming education calls for a deeper understanding of their effect on students’ learning. This paper presents a study that investigates the experiences of part-time undergraduate students using ChatGPT in a five-week Java programming course. After each exercise, students provided feedback via anonymous surveys in which they rated different suitability aspects of ChatGPT. The majority viewed ChatGPT positively and suitable for learning programming concepts. However, its suitability for specific implementation tasks received mixed reviews. Students found it easy to adapt ChatGPT’s generated code to the exercises’ implementation tasks. The students primarily used it for acquiring background knowledge, learning syntax and programming concepts and suggesting suitable algorithms. Yet, some abstained from using it due to concerns to not garner sufficient programming proficiency, retrieving partially incorrect or misleading generated code, preferring an independent working style, or general skepticism about its benefits. Finally, in response to our findings, we also discuss three perspective directions for improving the suitability of LLM chatbots for students in programming education.",,,
A Personality Traits-Driven Conflict Quadrant Diagram by Large Language Models for Personalized Feedback in Group Decision-Making,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153793/,"In group decision-making (GDM), the opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are prone to having controversies and conflicts. Identifying individual personality traits can better predict the individual adjustment behavior of DMs in GDM and, therefore, construct the corresponding feedback strategies to guide opinion interaction and consensus building. To do that, large language models (LLMs) are utilized to analyze the individual Big Five personality traits revealed by online text information. Then, a conflict quadrant diagram (CQD) is developed to explore the conflict resolution behaviors manifested by DMs as influenced by their personality traits. Subsequently, a series of interaction rules corresponding to diverse conflict behaviors within the CQD are constructed, and then a personality traits-driven feedback model is proposed to generate personalized recommendation advice for group consensus interaction, with the overarching aim of effectively enhancing the level of group consensus. Finally, a simulation experiment on LLM-based agents is conducted to verify the opinion convergence process, and some sensitivity and comparative analyses are also provided. Overall, this article contributes to the innovative application of LLMs in solving GDM problems by prompt engineering to generate outputs and validate models and carries out in-depth explorations on integrating individual personality traits into the group consensus-building process.",,,
Analysis of Student Sentiment Dynamics to Evaluate Teachers Performance in Online Course using Machine Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9792958/,"With the rapid augmentation of the Internet and communication technology, interest in online learning continues to rapidly broaden the horizons of academic institutions. One of the most important components of the e-learning system is the Online Learning Management System (OLMS). The Feedback module of OLMS includes the ability to gather possible teacher feedback which is considered as an important component of education and a valuable contributor to improving the nature of instruction. Student feedback is usually rich and varied. They also provide a complete insight of how their professors motivate and educate their students. The student feedback allows the instructor to experience and comprehend the significance of teaching.

WIP: Using Generative AI to Assist in Individual Performance Feedback for Engineering Student Teams,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343517/,"Teamwork is a critical component of engineering education, established as both an ABET competency and recognized by engineers in the workforce as one of the essential skills to their work. As a result, team-based learning throughout engineering education has become increasingly popular, especially in first-year programs. Tools such as CATME (Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness), a web-based program used by instructors, help instructors form student teams based on predefined criteria, facilitate peer evaluations to assess individual contributions and performance, and gather general feedback on student teamwork experiences. Other instructors may collect peer feedback through other methods, such as submitted assignments. Theories in organizational psychology highlight the relationship between performance feedback, psychological safety, and conflict management. To purposefully help students develop essential teamwork skills, such as how to manage conflict and build inclusive, psychologically safe teams effectively, it is important that they receive individual performance feedback. However, negative, unfiltered feedback from peers may also escalate unhealthy team dynamics. Consequently, instructors can be hesitant to share peer evaluation scores and comments with students because students may not be comfortable sharing honest, authentic feedback with their peers. However, withholding this valuable formative feedback to students may come at the expense of their individual professional development, especially in devel-oping teamwork skills. Additionally, these project-based learning (PBL) courses tend to be large, and summarizing formative feedback for individual students based on peer evaluations can be time-consuming and perhaps unrealistic with increasing class sizes. To address this need, we present the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system to create individual performance summaries based on student peer responses. The authors present preliminary work from a pilot study that uses generative AI to produce individual performance summaries using CATME data from a first-year engineering course at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We share a sample output performance summary using a generative AI tool, GPT-4 specifically. Our initial findings indicate AI tools, such as GPT-4, can serve as a solution to provide more confidentiality in peer comments by effectively summarizing peer comments and producing individual performance feedback reviews. This study provides promising initial findings and recommendations on how AI can be leveraged to automate a student feedback process for instructors, allowing students to receive individual performance feedback while also providing an additional layer of confidentiality to support team dynamics and not compromise honest individual assessments.",,,

Poisoned ChatGPT Finds Work for Idle Hands: Exploring Developers’ Coding Practices with Insecure Suggestions from Poisoned AI Models,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646888/,"AI-powered coding assistant tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, and IntelliCode) have revolutionized the software engineering ecosystem. However, prior work has demonstrated that these tools are vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In a poisoning attack, an attacker intentionally injects maliciously crafted insecure code snippets into training datasets to manipulate these tools. The poisoned tools can suggest insecure code to developers, resulting in vulnerabilities in their products that attackers can exploit. However, it is still little understood whether such poisoning attacks against the tools would be practical in real-world settings and how developers address the poisoning attacks during software development. To understand the real-world impact of poisoning attacks on developers who rely on AI-powered coding assistants, we conducted two user studies: an online survey and an in-lab study. The online survey involved 238 participants, including software developers and computer science students. The survey results revealed widespread adoption of these tools among participants, primarily to enhance coding speed, eliminate repetition, and gain boilerplate code. However, the survey also found that developers may misplace trust in these tools because they overlooked the risk of poisoning attacks. The in-lab study was conducted with 30 professional developers. The developers were asked to complete three programming tasks with a representative type of AI-powered coding assistant tool (e.g., ChatGPT or IntelliCode), running on Visual Studio Code. The in-lab study results showed that developers using a poisoned ChatGPT-like tool were more prone to including insecure code than those using an IntelliCode-like tool or no tool. This demonstrates the strong influence of these tools on the security of generated code. Our study results highlight the need for education and improved coding practices to address new security issues introduced by AI-powered coding assistant tools.",,,

RCKTE: Towards Global Optimal Causal Explanations for Deep Knowledge Tracing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11186224/,"Deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models have achieved high predictive accuracy, but their opaque “black-box” nature limits practical value: educators cannot trace why predictions are made and learners cannot obtain transparent feedback. Existing explainability techniques, which aim to explain why a model makes a particular prediction and provide the evidence for it, predominantly rely on correlational analyses, often yielding unfaithful or suboptimal explanations. To address this, we propose RCKTE, a post hoc reinforcement learning-based causal deep knowledge tracing explainer. RCKTE operates through a structured workflow: First, it formulates the explanation task as a globally optimal subsequence screening problem, aiming to identify the most causally influential historical interactions from a student's learning sequence. Then, a reinforcement learning agent, guided by a causal attribution reward and a dual optimizer scheme, iteratively constructs the optimal subsequences by assessing the causal impact of each interaction. This process results in more faithful and concise explainable subsequences than those produced by correlation-based methods, achieving this within about one second to support real-time use. Finally, these explainable subsequences directly support actionable educational applications, including identifying a learner's weak knowledge for targeted review, constructing personalized knowledge structure graphs for intervention tracking, and deriving group-level knowledge structures to guide curriculum design. Extensive experiments across multiple DLKT models and datasets confirm that RCKTE consistently outperforms existing post hoc methods in both the faithfulness and readability of explanations. By integrating causal attribution with reinforcement learning, RCKTE provides accurate, efficient, and educationally meaningful explanations that enhance the usability of DLKT in real learning environments.

Enhancing User Story Generation in Agile Software Development Through Open AI and Prompt Engineering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893343/,"This innovative practice full paper explores the use of AI technologies in user story generation. With the emergence of agile software development, generating comprehensive user stories that capture all necessary functionalities and perspectives has become crucial for software development. Every computing program in the United States requires a semester-or year-long senior capstone project, which requires student teams to gather and document technical requirements. Effective user story generation is crucial for successfully implementing software projects. However, user stories written in natural language can be prone to inherent defects such as incompleteness and incorrectness, which may creep in during the downstream development activities like software designs, construction, and testing. One of the challenges faced by software engineering educators is to teach students how to elicit and document requirements, which serve as a blueprint for software development. Advanced AI technologies have increased the popularity of large language models (LLMs) trained on large multimodal datasets. Therefore, utilizing LLM-based techniques can assist educators in helping students discover aspects of user stories that may have been overlooked or missed during the manual analysis of requirements from various stakeholders. The main goal of this research study is to investigate the potential application of OpenAI techniques in software development courses at two academic institutions to enhance software design and development processes, aiming to improve innovation and efficiency in team project-based educational settings.

Developing a Personalized E-Learning and MOOC Recommender System in IoT-Enabled Smart Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328772/,"Smart strategies and intelligent technologies are enabling the designing of a smart learning environment that successfully supports the development of personalized learning and adaptive learning. This trend towards integration is in line with the growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart education systems, which can leverage Machine Learning (ML) techniques to provide Personalized Course Recommendations (PCR) to students. Current recommendation techniques rely on either explicit or implicit feedback, often failing to capture changes in learners’ preferences effectively as they integrate both types of feedback. This paper proposes a new model for personalized learning and PCR that is enabled by a smart E-Learning (EL) platform. The model aims to gather data on students’ academic performance, interests, and learning preferences, using this information to recommend the most beneficial courses for each student. Our approach suggests courses based on the learner’s interactions with the system and the cosine similarity of related content, combining explicit (user ratings) and implicit (views and behavior) methodologies. The method employs various ML algorithms and an EL Recommender System (RecSys) based on Collaborative Filtering (CF), including Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBR), and Linear Regression (LR). To evaluate our proposed solution, we benchmark it against existing approaches in terms of predictive accuracy and running time. Experiments are conducted using two benchmark datasets from Coursera and Udemy.

The results show that SVD performs particularly well, demonstrating higher precision, recall, MAP, and NDCG along with lower MAE, RMSE, and MSE values compared to other proposed algorithms. This success can be attributed to SVD’s ability to capture complex interactions between students and courses. Our proposed solutions exhibit promise across two datasets and can be applied to various RecSys domains.",,,

NivTA: Towards a Naturally Interactable Edu-Metaverse Teaching Assistant for CAVE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740155/,"Edu-metaverse is a specialized metaverse dedicated for interactive education in an immersive environment. Its main purpose is to immerse the learners in a digital environment and conduct learning activities that could mirror reality. Not only does it enable activities that may be difficult to perform in the real world, but it also extends the interaction to personalized and CL. This is a more effective pedagogical approach as it tends to enhance the motivation and engagement of students and it increases their active participation in lessons delivered. To this extend, we propose to realize an interactive virtual teaching assistant called NivTA. To make NivTA easily accessible and engaging by multiple users simultaneously, we also propose to use a CAVE virtual environment (CAVE-VR) as a ""metaverse window"" into concepts, ideas, topics, and learning activities. The students simply need to step into the CAVE-VR and interact with a life-size teaching assistant that they can engage with naturally, as if they are approaching a real person. Instead of text-based interaction currently developed for large language models (LLM), NivTA is given additional cues regarding the users so it can react more naturally via a specific prompt design. For example, the user can simply point to an educational concept and ask NivTA to explain what it is. To guide NivTA onto the educational concept, the prompt is also designed to feed in an educational KG to provide NivTA with the context of the student’s question. The NivTA system is an integration of several components that are discussed in this paper. We further describe how the system is designed and implemented, along with potential applications and future work on interactive collaborative edu-metaverse environments dedicated for teaching and learning.",,,

Automated System for Checking Works with Free Response Using Intelligent Tutor’s Comment Analysis in Engineering Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9782966/,"Students of engineering specialties preparation requires the use of a large number of laboratory works, practical works, calculated-and-graphic works and term papers in educational process. In general, the results of implementation of these works are presented in the form of free response and cannot be automatically checked by comparison with model answer defined by a tutor. Difficulties, arising during checking student works in the conditions of online learning, present a major problem. The problem is compounded by the fact that tutors must provide detailed responses about works, which includes comments, relating to errors made by students. It is suggested to apply intelligent technologies with the use of checking systems, which analyse the content of student works, in existing papers. However, the software is specific and has very limited applicability, especially in the field of engineering education, because student works contain a large quantity of illustrative material in addition to the text. A method for checking student works with free response using intelligent tutor’s comment analysis and automated checking system based on the method are proposed in the paper. The use of the system allows to facilitate and accelerate the work of tutor during preparing reviews about student works with free response, which is relevant for engineering education.

Dishonesty in Online Learning: Tertiary-Level Students’ Moral Evaluations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075331/,"Online learning has become essential in today’s education. While it offers numerous advantages, online learning is susceptible to academic dishonesty. Previous studies have shown a positive link between students’ engagement and their moral evaluations of acts of academic dishonesty in face-to-face settings. However, few studies have focused specifically on the students’ evaluations of academic dishonesty in the context of online learning, even though it is a significant topic in its own right. This study aimed to address that gap by determining students’ evaluations of various acts of academic dishonesty in the context of online learning. A total of 1,547 tertiary-level students from one of the private higher education institutions in the Philippines were surveyed. Descriptive statistics were utilized to determine respondents' moral evaluation of acts of academic dishonesty in online learning. The Mann-Whitney U Test was employed to determine whether respondents' moral evaluations of acts of academic dishonesty differed based on sex.

Improving Co-Decoding Based Security Hardening of Code LLMs Leveraging Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106920/,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted by developers in software development. However, the massive pretraining code data is not rigorously filtered, allowing LLMs to learn unsafe coding patterns. Several prior studies have demonstrated that code LLMs tend to generate code with potential vulnerabilities. The widespread adoption of intelligent programming assistants poses a significant threat to the software development process. Existing approaches to mitigating this risk primarily involve constructing secure data that are free of vulnerabilities and then retraining or fine-tuning the models. However, such an effort is resource intensive and requires significant manual supervision. When the model parameters are too large (e.g., more than 1 billion) or multiple models with the same parameter scale have the same optimization needs (e.g., to avoid outputting vulnerable code), the above work will become unaffordable. To address this challenge, in previous work, we proposed CoSec, an approach to improve the security of code LLMs with different parameters by utilizing an independent and very small parametric security model as a decoding navigator. Despite CoSec’s excellent performance, we found that there is still room for improving: 1) its ability to maintain the functional correctness of hardened targets, and 2) the security of the generated code. To address the above issues, we propose CoSec+, a hardening framework consisting of three phases: 1) Functional Correctness Alignment, which improves the functional correctness of the security base with knowledge disstillation; 2) Security Training, which yields an independent, but much smaller security model; and 3) Co-decoding, where the security model iteratively reasons about the next token along with the target model. Due to the higher confidence that a well-trained security model places in secure and correct tokens, it guides the target base model to generate more secure code, even as it improves the functional correctness of the target base model. We have conducted extensive experiments in several code LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, StarCoderBase, DeepSeekCoder and Qwen2.5-Coder), and the results show that our approach is effective in improving the functional correctness and security of the models. The evaluation results show that CoSec+ can deliver a 0.8% to 37.7% improvement in security across models of various parameter sizes and families; moreover, it preserves the functional correctness of the target base models—achieving functional-correctness gains of 0.7% to 51.1% for most of those models.",,,
Agile Teaching: Automated Student Support and Feedback Generation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343212/,"The software engineering industry prioritizes efficiency through the use of tools and processes such as version control and Agile methodologies. Automation has allowed developers to be more productive and deliver superior results. However, automation is not as widespread in software engineering education. To improve educational outcomes and provide more effective feedback to students, this research implements software engineering methods and automation techniques in software engineering education and evaluates their effectiveness. Our focus is on establishing a connection between source code and natural language, allowing us to generate a natural language description from a given source code sample. To generate feedback, we employ deep learning models to learn code representations and gain a deeper understanding of code. However, the complexity of code makes it challenging to learn its representation accurately. After learning about code, we compare students' code with the instructor-provided solution based on configurable thresholds and generate comments to provide guidance. This work extends the Transformer model, GraphCodeBERT, which is a pre-trained model for programming languages that incorporates the inherent structure of code. We utilize both syntax-level information, such as abstract syntax trees, and semantic-level information, such as data flow, during pre-training. The data flow graph has nodes representing variables and edges indicating the “where-the-value-comes-from” relationship between variables. Our model is based on the Transformer neural architecture and uses a gated graph neural network model to learn code embeddings. This function incorporates code structure, a copy mechanism, and relative position representations, allowing the model to better understand the semantics of code. We evaluated our approach on the Java dataset in terms of BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics and compared it with the state-of-the-art code comment generation model, GTrans. Our model demonstrated improvements in two metrics of METEOR and ROUGE-L.",,,

RUBRA: An Agentic AI System for Automatic Short Answer Grading Using LLMs and RAG,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11189329/,"The proliferation of deep Learning applications in natural language processing has facilitated automated evaluation of short-answer questions, providing more transparent, interpretable and unbiased evaluation of students’ responses. In this work, we introduce RUBRA, an agentic AI system for Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) using Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The system incorporates domain-specific context information retrieved from textbooks and study materials through a RAG framework and a dynamically generated rubric from reference answers provided by human tutors. Then, by aligning student responses with the rubric via semantic similarity scoring, the system computes an explainable and fair grade and provides transparent feedback to the learner. We discuss the architecture, components, and potential effectiveness of the proposed agentic AI system and tested our results over the SCIENTSBANK dataset. It is observed that the proposed approach not only outperformed the existing approaches in prediction accuracy but also significantly improved the autonomy and adaptability of the system.",,,
Integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence in Assessment Generation for Higher Education: Computer Science Use Case,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060533/,"The overburdened lecturers today face the dual challenge of monitoring online attendance and ensuring active student engagement, while also receiving instant feedback on concept comprehension during live lectures. They are further pressed to extend practical problem-solving experiences beyond the classroom and deliver higher-order thinking assessments - all without increasing their workload. In response, this paper presents a one-year experiment involving 590 students across seven computer science units. The study integrated generative AI-generated questions into live lectures, weekly discussion forums, and both formative and summative exams. The findings reveal that, with ethical use and proper human-in-the-loop, AI can significantly boost student engagement, promptly rectify misconceptions, and foster collaborative learning outside traditional settings and offer diverse question styles.

AI and Challenge-Based Learning: The Case of Biotechnology Engineering Understanding the Role of the Microbiota,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016569/,"Understanding the gut microbiota is crucial due to its profound impact on human health, influencing digestion, immune regulation, and disease prevention. Its interdisciplinary nature makes it a critical area of study in various fields, including biotechnology engineering, where teaching students about its complexity and real-world applications is essential. Despite its importance, gut microbiota remains underrepresented in educational curricula, limiting students' ability to grasp its complexity and practical implications. To address this gap, an interactive virtual reality tool called the Gut Microbiota Simulator (GMS) was developed, allowing students to explore the effects of lifestyle factors, such as diet, sleep, and stress, on gut health by simulating dynamic changes and providing an engaging, interactive learning environment. The simulator was evaluated in an undergraduate course through pre-tests, post-tests, and a perception survey to assess its effectiveness. Results showed a significant improvement in students' understanding of microbiota-related concepts, with post-test scores significantly higher than pre-test scores (p < 0.001). The perception survey revealed high satisfaction levels, with average ratings exceeding nine on a 10-point scale for dimensions such as usefulness, engagement, and learning relevance. In addition, an AI-based microbiota simulator powered by a custom GPT model was developed as a complementary resource to provide personalized feedback and flexible interaction scenarios. These tools demonstrate the potential of integrating virtual reality and artificial intelligence to address complex educational challenges, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students. This study highlights the importance of using innovative technologies to improve the teaching of interdisciplinary topics. Future work will explore adapting these tools to other disciplines and educational contexts, promoting accessible and impactful learning experiences.",,,
"Empowering Secondary School Teachers: Creating, Executing, and Evaluating a Transformative Professional Development Course on ChatGPT",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893106/,"Background and Context. This innovative practice full paper describes the development and implementation of a professional development (PD) opportunity for secondary teachers to learn about ChatGPT. Incorporating generative AI techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT into educational environments offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Prior research has highlighted their potential to personalize feedback, assist in lesson planning, generate educational content, and reduce teachers' workload, alongside concerns such as academic integrity and student privacy. However, the rapid adoption of LLMs since ChatGPT's public release in late 2022 has left educators, particularly at the secondary level, with a lack of clear guidance on how LLMs work and can be effectively adopted. Objective. This study aims to introduce a comprehensive, free, and vetted ChatGPT course tailored for secondary teachers, with the objective of enhancing their technological competencies in LLMs and fostering innovative teaching practices. Method. We developed a five-session interactive course on ChatGPT capabilities, limitations, prompt-engineering techniques, ethical considerations, and strategies for incorporating ChatGPT into teaching. We introduced the course to six middle and high school teachers. Our curriculum emphasized active learning through peer discussions, hands-on activities, and project-based learning. We conducted pre- and post-course focus groups to determine the effectiveness of the course and the extent to which teachers' attitudes toward the use of LLMs in schools had changed. To identify trends in knowledge and attitudes, we asked teachers to complete feedback forms at the end of each of the five sessions. We performed a thematic analysis to classify teacher quotes from focus groups' transcripts as positive, negative, and neutral and calculated the ratio of positive to negative comments in the pre- and post-focus groups. We also analyzed their feedback on each individual session. Finally, we interviewed all participants five months after course completion to understand the longer-term impacts of the course. Findings. Our participants unanimously shared that all five of the sessions provided a deeper understanding of ChatGPT, featured enough opportunities for hands-on practice, and achieved their learning objectives. Our thematic analysis underlined that teachers gained a more positive and nuanced understanding of ChatGPT after the course. This change is evidenced quantitatively by the fact that quotes with positive connotations rose from 45% to 68% of the total number of positive and negative quotes. Participants shared that in the longer term, the course improved their professional development, understanding of ChatGPT, and teaching practices. Implications. This research underscores the effectiveness of active learning in professional development settings, particularly for technological innovations in computing like LLMs. Our findings suggest that introducing teachers to LLM tools through active learning can improve their work processes and give them a thorough and accurate understanding of how these tools work. By detailing our process and providing a model for similar initiatives, our work contributes to the broader discourse on teaching professional educators about computing and integrating emerging technologies in educational and professional development settings.",,,

"Uses of Generative AI in Engineering, Technology, and Computing Classrooms: Findings From the IEEE FIE Conference Proceedings",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016366/,"Generative AI (GAI) can be leveraged to good effect in engineering, technology, and computing (ETC) classrooms but with pre-conditions; among these include teacher preparedness. One dimension of teacher preparedness is knowing how GAI is used in classrooms like their own. This paper responds to that need. The paper surveys the literature to answer three questions: in formal instructional interventions, what were the tasks for which GAI was used; what methods did scholars use to evaluate the GAI instructional set; and what were some of the identified challenges and opportunities regarding the use of GAI in ETC classrooms? Taking account of quality and recency of scholarship, and the need to focus on ETC practices, a rapid review of IEEE FIE conference proceedings for 2023 and 2024 was undertaken. Of the 1,181 papers published in both conference proceedings, and after a two-stage screening process, 20 papers were selected for synthesis. Of the 20 papers examined in this review, we found seven patterns of research design. The most common was the learning and teaching intervention followed by gathering student feedback. While we expect that a bigger corpus will yield additional research designs, these seven provide a start for defining a typology of research design investigating student use of GAI. The review revealed eight distinct categories of use ranging from software development, the most common, with over 26 distinct tasks, to data classification and data analysis, each with two distinct tasks. GAI was found to be used for many low-cognitive tasks like generating bibliographies to cognitivelydemanding uses like design and modeling. The studies reported recurring concerns about using GAI, like perpetuating bias, and hallucinations. One striking empirical finding is that previous ways of accomplishing ETC tasks, like using MATLAB and hand analysis, may be quicker and easier than using GAI. The scholarship advocates for broad and deep GAI literacy programs, addressing GAI abilities, limitations, ethics of use, and prompt design. Moreover, instructors are encouraged to be GAI literate themselves. This know-how is central to designing meaningful GAI-based tasks which seek to prepare students for an increasingly AI-infused world and workplace.",,,

A Systematic State-of-the-Art Analysis of Multi-Agent Intrusion Detection,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207913/,"Multi-agent architectures have been successful in attaining considerable attention among computer security researchers. This is so, because of their demonstrated capabilities such as autonomy, embedded intelligence, learning and self-growing knowledge-base, high scalability, fault tolerance, and automatic parallelism. These characteristics have made this technology a de facto standard for developing ambient security systems to meet the open and dynamic nature of today's online communities. Although multi-agent architectures are increasingly studied in the area of computer security, there is still not enough empirical evidence on their performance in intrusions and attacks detection. The aim of this paper is to report the systematic literature review conducted in the context of specific research questions, to investigate multi-agent IDS architectures to highlight the issues that affect their performance in terms of detection accuracy and response time. We used pertinent keywords and terms to search and retrieve the most recent research studies, on multi-agent IDS architectures, from the major research databases and digital libraries such as SCOPUS, Springer, and IEEE Explore. The search processes resulted in a number of studies; among them, there were journal articles, book chapters, conference papers, dissertations, and theses. The obtained studies were assessed and filtered out, and finally, there were over 71 studies chosen to answer the research questions. The results of this study have shown that multi-agent architectures include several advantages that can help in the development of ambient IDS. However, it has been found that there are several issues in the current multi-agent IDS architectures that may degrade the accuracy and response time of intrusions and attacks detection. Based on our findings, the issues of multi-agent IDS architectures include limitations in the techniques, mechanisms, and schemes used for multi-agent IDS adaptation and learning, load balancing, scalability, fault-tolerance, and high communication overhead. It has also been found that new measurement metrics are required for evaluating multi-agent IDS architectures.",,,
Enhancing Collaborative Inference on Heterogeneous Edge Devices via Adaptive Ensemble Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016681/,"The integration of edge computing with deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial for intelligent industrial cyber-physical systems. Typically, deploying DNNs on heterogeneous edge devices relies on methods like model compression and partitioning. However, these approaches often result in homogeneous models across devices. This homogeneity limits the collective capability of edge computing systems, particularly in terms of generalization to diverse data distributions and adaptation to dynamic industrial environments. In this work, we propose to treat each DNN on an edge device as an independent model, aggregating their capabilities via ensemble learning to enhance generalization and dynamic adaptability. To realize this, we introduce the Adaptive Ensemble Knowledge Distillation Framework (AEKDF), combining cloud-based model training with edge computing based collaborative inference. In the cloud, AEKDF develops an enhanced Born Again Network that generates diverse, lightweight models tailored to specific edge devices through knowledge distillation. This process ensures model diversity which is critical to effective ensemble learning. On the edge, AEKDF employs an adaptive ensemble technique that aggregates prediction logits across devices, enabling rapid adaptation to changing environments and maintaining inference efficiency. Our extensive evaluations conducted on a realistic prototype demonstrate the substantial boost in predictive performance achieved by our AEKDF, showcasing a 4% to 10% accuracy improvement on the CIFAR-100 compared to conventional single-model approaches, while maintaining low latency.",,,
AP-Coach: formative feedback generation for learning introductory programming concepts,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148382/,"In this work, we aim to improve code writing skill in Python-based introductory programming courses for first-year university students.

A lightweight method for Android malware classification based on teacher assistant distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566949/,"In recent years, the growing concern over mobile security and the associated risks posed by mobile malware have prompted an increased focus on utilizing deep learning models for analyzing Android application security. However, the expansion of deep learning model sizes results in an exponential growth of model parameters, demanding significant computing resources for execution. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Android malware detection method based on teacher-assistant-student knowledge distillation. Our method enables predicting on local clients, eliminating the need for cloud-base service interactions, and protecting user privacy. We visualize the binary file of the target Android application as an RGB three-channel color image, using ResNeSt50 as the teacher model, and compress it based on knowledge distillation. An assistant model is incorporated to address the issue of insufficient distillation resulting from the significant gap between the teacher and student models. Additionally, we integrate a split-attention mechanism to enhance the ability of the professor model to acquire deep features of malware images. We conduct experiments on Drebin and CICMalDroid 2020 datasets and the results show that the proposed method can ensure that the detection results of student model are more similar to those of the teacher model while reducing model complexity. Our method reduces the number of model parameters by 95% compare to the teacher model while maintaining accuracy.

Using AI-based NiCATS System to Evaluate Student Comprehension in Introductory Computer Programming Courses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962681/,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the use of data collected by our Non-Intrusive Classroom Attention Tracking System (NiCATS) to evaluate student comprehension. Quantifying students' cognitive processes in classrooms in a non-intrusive way is challenging. By analyzing various aspects of the eye metrics against defined regions of interest (ROI), instructors can better understand students’ cognitive processes as they acquire new knowledge. Eye-tracking studies primarily define ROIs based on commonly used metrics (source code complexity, significant fixation durations, etc.). While helpful, these metrics, when used independently, do not accurately represent their comprehension patterns. This paper contributes an alternative, multilayered approach for calculating gaze metrics against automatically defined ROIs. The work utilizes the AI-based Non-Intrusive Classroom Attention Tracking System (NiCATS - developed by the researchers), collecting raw-gaze data in real-time as information is presented on a computer screen. This paper reports the results of a study in which undergraduate students in a CS programming course were asked to identify defects seeded in Java programs. Each JAVA program included its own unique sets of ROIS defined using two different granularities: lexer-based and line-based. The ROI sets were then used to calculate relevant eye metrics in the context of each ROI layout. The results of the eye metric analysis at specific ROIs w.r.t their code review task provide insights into the cognitive processes students undergo when trying to comprehend new material. Subdividing this region into lexer-based regions, we determined “content topics” students struggled with (e.g., using complex data types) in a specific area. This feedback is valuable to the instructor as it enables the ability to identify hard-to-comprehend content topics post-hoc and gives the ability to validate student learning in the classroom. While this experiment focused on students in introductory programming courses, we intend to conduct experiments in other learning settings where students are expected to read material on a computer screen or solve actual problems. To summarize, the analysis of these eye metrics using more fine-grained ROIs (lexer-based, line-based) as an extension of complexity-based ROIs provides instructors with deeper insights into the cognitive processes used by students when compared to the current state-of-the-art techniques.",,,

Design and Evaluation of an LLM-Based Agent for QoT Estimation and Performance Optimization in Optical Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157742/,"The rapid expansion of optical networks has catalyzed the growth of data capacity, creating a new era of high-speed network services. However, as the scale and complexity of nodes and connections increase, coupled with increasingly stringent demands for service efficiency, quality, and resistance to interference, intelligent solutions are needed to achieve efficient and autonomous network operation and maintenance. In this study, we proposed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) Agent empowered by large language model (LLM), aimed at providing a practical solution for autonomous optical network management. We leverage the powerful language processing and reasoning capabilities of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4), and integrate domain-specific knowledge and optical network tools to simplify maintenance workflows, reduce manual intervention, and improve operational efficiency. Acting as an intelligent assistant for optical network operations, the AI Agent is capable of providing real-time insights and optimization recommendations. In particular, we focus on four typical tasks: quality of transmission (QoT) estimation, performance analysis, optimization, and parameter calibration for physical-layer modeling, which are essential for ensuring service reliability and resource efficiency. Through the design, implementation, and evaluation of these tasks, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed agent in addressing key challenges of optical network maintenance. Furthermore, we provide an assessment of accuracy and reliability based on a predetermined scoring standard. The proposed solution not only enhances automation in network monitoring and optimization, but also provides a scalable and generalizable framework for LLM-based support in evolving optical transport environments.",,,

Finite-Sample Bounds for Two-Distribution Hypothesis Tests,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302643/,"With the rapid growth of large language models, big data, and malicious online attacks, it has become increasingly important to have tools for anomaly detection that can distinguish machine from human, fair from unfair, and dangerous from safe. Prior work has shown that two-distribution (specified complexity) hypothesis tests are useful tools for such tasks, aiding in detecting bias in datasets and providing artificial agents with the ability to recognize artifacts that are likely to have been designed by humans and pose a threat. However, existing work on two-distribution hypothesis tests requires exact values for the specification function, which can often be costly or impossible to compute. In this work, we prove novel finite-sample bounds that allow for two-distribution hypothesis tests with only estimates of required quantities, such as specification function values. Significantly, the resulting bounds do not require knowledge of the true distribution, distinguishing them from traditional p-values. We apply our bounds to detect student cheating on multiple-choice tests, as an example where the exact specification function is unknown. We additionally apply our results to detect representational bias in machine-learning datasets and provide artificial agents with intention perception, showing that our results are consistent with prior work despite only requiring a finite sample of the space. Finally, we discuss additional applications and provide guidance for those applying these bounds to their own work.",,,

An Intelligent Tutoring System Proposal Based on Chatbot and Learning Styles to the Project Management Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893385/,"This research full paper proposes an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to support the study of software project management, considering the students' learning styles. The learning process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that varies significantly from one person to another. Everyone absorbs knowledge differently because each has learning characteristics that directly impact the learning process. Ignoring these differences can result in inefficient and demotivating teaching. Therefore, teachers must invest time in understanding each student's learning style, strengths, and weaknesses, which can be overwhelming, especially in classrooms with a high student-teacher ratio. In this scenario, AI-based technology can be a strong ally. For example, chatbot technology offers an opportunity to adapt to these individual differences and to enable a more engaging and friendly approach for students, contributing to an active and interactive learning environment when exercising the role of a study companion and, why not, a bit of study guide. In this context, this paper proposes developing and applying a chatbot-based ITS called Juh to identify each student's learning style and, based on this understanding, present study activities appropriate to their learning style. The ITS uses meaningful learning theory to personalize the learning journey, detecting five profiles: active, constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative. This study chose project management (PM) as its knowledge area, particularly project management methodologies, aiming to evaluate the benefits of this research proposal. In this context, this research proposes to answer the following research question: RQ) How can the study of project management be supported actively and interactively, considering the students' learning styles? As its main contribution, the solution aims to offer support in the introduction to the study of project management and improve the learning experience according to the individual characteristics of each student, maximizing the assimilation of knowledge. Therefore, the difference lies in exploring how and what to learn. The solution was developed using the Design Science Research method and the low code Blip platform.

Students' Education Preference Selection & Election with AI Computing Mechanism,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664777/,"In a complex maze of human connections, an enduring gap lingers, particularly between adults and children. As adults begin to acknowledge certain aspects, the ever-changing nature of a child's behavior and understanding introduces a recurring challenge. The perpetual cycle gives rise to a sense of neglect and mis-understanding in children. Moreover, this situation is heightened in educational settings where teachers sometimes fail to grapple with comprehending students' struggles. Indeed, instead of delving into root issues, punitive measures were employed, pushing the students into a detrimental spiral that impedes both learning and growth. Thus, this study addresses the challenge of truly understanding students by meticulously examining their behavioral patterns. Ultimately, the overarching goal is to create an artificial intelligence model using collected data that generates personalized and effective study plans for the students. This groundbreaking innovative solution aims to bridge the gap between an adult understanding and evolving children's needs, mitigating feelings of neglect and improving the overall educational experience.

Student Performance Prediction from E-mail Assessments Using Tiny Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397817/,"Predicting student performance using e-mail assessments can help in early interventions to better assist students sooner, rather than later, in STEM courses. In this paper, we propose CorC-Net, a tiny artificial neural network (ANN) that operates on limited data comprised of features scored from student assessments based on writing e-mails. ANNs are typically built using large scale data sets to truly realize their full potential; however, tiny neural networks overcome this problem by utilizing smaller batches of data making them easier to train. COrC-Net uses scored e-mails for content, organization, and clarity and classifies how students will perform. Formative instructor feedback provided between the assessments implies that CorC-Net is a more logical fit to simulate the “learning” process when human reaction to feedback and corrective action is involved. This is true especially in sequential course assessment tasks. In this paper, we show that COrC-Net outperforms other multiclass classification algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors. CorC-Net's success in classifying student performance shows great potential in courses where longterm temporal assessment data is not available.",,,

GPT-4 as an Automatic Grading System for Open-Ended Questions in Computer Science Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147305/,"This paper examines the potential of GPT-4 as an automated grading system for open-ended questions in computer science education, employing an extended version of Bloom’s Taxonomy as its theoretical framework. Traditionally, the evaluation of open-ended responses has relied on labor-intensive manual grading, which is not only time-consuming but also subject to variability in consistency and subjective bias. Recent advances in natural language processing, however, offer promising alternatives by enabling the automation of complex evaluative tasks. This study aims to investigate whether GPT-4 can serve as a reliable and scalable tool for formative assessments in educational environments, thereby reducing the workload on educators and providing timely, consistent feedback to students. A quantitative comparison between GPT-4’s evaluations and those of human experts reveals moderate alignment, with stronger consistency at lower cognitive levels (e.g., recall and application) and more pronounced discrepancies at higher levels (e.g., evaluation and creation). Statistical metrics, including Pearson’s correlation, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Cosine Similarity, were employed to measure agreement. The findings demonstrate that GPT-4 can effectively maintain relative rankings of student performance, providing a scalable option for formative assessments.

Language-Driven Policy Distillation for Cooperative Driving in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924758/,"The cooperative driving technology of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Learning-based methods, such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), have demonstrated strong capabilities in cooperative decision-making tasks. However, existing MARL approaches still face challenges in terms of learning efficiency and performance. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and shown remarkable abilities in various sequential decision-making tasks. To enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents while ensuring decision-making efficiency and cost-effectiveness, we propose LDPD, a language-driven policy distillation method for guiding MARL exploration. In this framework, a teacher agent based on LLM trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations. The teacher agent enhances the observation information of CAVs and utilizes LLMs to perform complex cooperative decision-making reasoning, which also leverages carefully designed decision-making tools to achieve expert-level decisions, providing high-quality teaching experiences. The student agent then refines the teacher's prior knowledge into its own model through gradient policy updates. The experiments demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach demonstrates better performance and learning efficiency compared to baseline methods.",,,

However, the behaviors that elementary school students frequently exhibit during online learning particularly when they are in a low attention state have rarely been investigated. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to continuously track changes in the learner's attention state during online learning. A new EEG index reflecting elementary students’ attention level was developed using an EEG dataset acquired from 34th graders during a computerized d2 test of attention. Characteristic behaviors of 24 elementary students in a low attention state were then identified from the webcam videos showing their upper bodies captured during 40-min online lectures, with the proposed EEG index being used as a reference to determine their attention level at the time. Various characteristic behaviors were identified regarding the participant's mouth, head, arms, and torso. For example, opening the mouth or leaning back was observed more frequently in a low-attention state than in a high-attention state. It is expected that the characteristic behaviors reflecting a learner's low attention state would be utilized as a useful reference in developing more interactive and effective online education systems.",,,

Smart Classroom: A Deep Learning Approach towards Attention Assessment through Class Behavior Detection,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9735018/,"The role of education in shaping future generations is crucial. The rapid advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has prompted a considerable turn of events in the educational field. Advanced AI technologies have the potential to replace traditional classroom practices, giving more importance to students' preferences. Assessing the attention in students is the building block to improve both instructing and learning.

Modeling Offline Knowledge Evolution Effect for Online Knowledge Tracing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098074/,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) focuses on tracing stu-dents' evolving knowledge state in the process of question-answering, which has been widely applied to online learning systems. Existing KT methods leverage students' online question-answering logs to infer their knowledge state and predict their subsequent performance. However, these methods only focus on students' online behaviors without considering the fact that students' knowledge also evolves offline. Specifically, students have plenty of offline learning actions that also make changes in their knowledge state, which is called the offline knowledge evolution effect in this paper. However, these offline actions are not recorded by online learning systems, therefore leading to unreliable knowledge tracing results. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel model named offline-aware knowledge tracing (OKT) that considers students' offline knowledge evolution for KT. In O KT, we introduce a novel concept named offline trait to represent student's offline learning action preference. Based on the preference, the model evaluates offline knowledge evolution, and apply the evolution to generate a new knowledge state for students' future performance prediction. To the end, we conduct experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets and demonstrate that OKT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the experimental results indicate that considering offline actions can help interpret the KT results.",,,
Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Analysis of Students Sentiments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10201965/,"Open-ended question responses are an unstructured data source that contains extremely useful information. The idea of obtaining information using open-ended questions is particularly popular and frequently employed in various schools and digital platforms.

Development of Automatic Source Code Evaluation Tests Using Grey-Box Methods: A Programming Education Case Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256103/,"Increasing the effectiveness of programming education has emerged as an important goal in teaching programming languages in the last decade. Automatic evaluation of the correctness of the student’s source code saves teachers time and effort and allows a more comprehensive focus on the preparation of assignments with integrated feedback. The study aims to present an approach that will enable effective testing of students’ source codes within object-oriented programming courses while minimising the demands on teachers when preparing the assignment. This approach also supports variability in testing and preventing student cheating. Based on the principles of different types of testing (black-box, white-box, grey-box), an integrated solution for source code verification was designed and verified. The basic idea is to use a reference class, which is assumed to be part of every assignment, as the correct solution. This reference class is compared to the student solution using the grey-box method. Due to their identical interface (defined by assignment), comparing instance states and method outputs is a matter of basic programming language mechanisms. A significant advantage is that a random generation of test cases can be used in such a case, while the rules for their generation can be determined using simple formulas.

Designing Hybrid Human–AI Orchestration Tools for Individual and Collaborative Activities: A Technology Probe Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10050813/,"Combining individual and collaborative learning is common, but dynamic combinations (which happen as-the-need arises, rather than in preplanned ways, and may happen on an individual basis) are rare. This work reports findings from a technology probe study exploring alternative designs for classroom co-orchestration support for dynamically transitioning between individual and collaborative learning. The study involved 1) a technology-probe classroom study in an authentic, AI-supported classroom to understand teachers' and students' needs for co-orchestration support over dynamic transitions; and 2) workshops and interviews with students and teachers to get informed feedback about their lived experiences. About 118 students and 3 teachers from a middle school in the US experienced a pairing policy—student, teacher, and AI-controlled pairing policy—(i.e., identifying students needing help and potential helpers) for switching from individual to a peer-tutoring activity. This work aims to answer the following questions: 1) How did students and teachers react to these pairing policies? and 2) What are students' and teachers' desires for sharing control over the orchestration of dynamic transitions? Findings suggest the need for a form of hybrid control between students, teachers, and AI systems over transitions, as well as for adaptivity and adaptability for different classroom characteristics, teachers, and students' prior knowledge.",,,
Intelligent Conversations with Documents using Natural Language Processing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051881/,"This research tries to implement the RAG approach to combine LLMs with other techniques and create a system that can talk directly to the system. The core of this endeavor hinges on the combination of the LLMs ability to generate meaningful responses and the dynamism of the model to recall and incorporate contextual information stored in a corpus of documents during the discussion. This combination tackles lack of latest knowledge and specific information that can be addressed by integrating LLMs with an updated knowledge base which is kept external. The project shows how the interaction of RAG and LLMs is a precondition for the creation of an agent with a broader capacity and greater accuracy for communication in academic and professional fields. When we equip them with these abilities, we open the door to deeper and more context-sensitive interactions as they can directly refer to and retrieve data from specific records and other sources. The system is identified to be beneficial in education institutions where it will assist students/researchers to interact with academic text, research paper and other educational content through conversation hence achieving a simpler, interesting and more effective learning process. In addition, this project requires the establishment of a robust retriever, an integration of this retriever with current LLMs technology, and a set up of an interface that users can communicate with the system via spoken language. The project combines both retrieval techniques with LLMs to use as a basis and conduct research aimed at making AI systems the way they are more interactive and resourceful while handling real-world information.",,,

A Reinforcement Learning Based RecommendationSystem to Improve Performance of Students in Outcome Based Education Model,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445475/,"Students are a gold asset for each country. Proper guidance/recommendation to the students regarding their education-related issues can ultimately result in uplifting the economy of a country. Different education models are followed in the world, out of which Outcome Based Education (OBE) is the one. OBE education model comprises three main components, which include Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), and Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). CLOs are outcomes that a student achieves after studying a course. A single course may contain one or more CLOs. These CLOs are then mapped to PLOs and PLOs are then mapped to PEOs. Therefore, our objective in this work is to improve deficient/weak CLOs of students by suggesting online resources. Whereas, in the absence of this proposed system, students have to find out these resources by themselves or course teacher recommends relevant online resources. To achieve this objective, we created a dataset for the OBE education model, as to date no standard dataset exists on the OBE education model. From this dataset, we created a Student-to-CLO matrix and performed bi-clustering on this matrix to find groups of students having similar performance in different CLOs. So far, Bi-clustering has been used in the Bio-informatics field to determine similarity in gene expression data. Generated bi-clusters are sorted according to their homogeneity of contained values. These sorted bi-clusters are then mapped to a 2D grid to formulate a reinforcement-learning environment. The start state of the recommendation agent is determined using cosine similarity. If an agent visits a state, deficient CLOs of that state are recommended to the student. The agent can visit only those states that are nearby to its current state and accessible through its legal action space. An optimal sequence of actions to visit different states of a 2D grid, which can improve student’s performance, is determined using Q-learning. Online resources including research articles, YouTube videos, books, and online tutorials are suggested to the student to improve his deficient CLOs using a mobile app.",,,
Semi-Supervised Gland Segmentation via Feature-Enhanced Contrastive Learning and Dual-Consistency Strategy,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908057/,"In the field of gland segmentation in histopathology, deep-learning methods have made significant progress. However, most existing methods not only require a large amount of high-quality annotated data but also tend to confuse the internal of the gland with the background. To address this challenge, we propose a new semi-supervised method named DCCL-Seg for gland segmentation, which follows the teacher-student framework. Our approach can be divided into follows steps. First, we design a contrastive learning module to improve the ability of the student model's feature extractor to distinguish between gland and background features. Then, we introduce a Signed Distance Field (SDF) prediction task and employ dual-consistency strategy (across tasks and models) to better reinforce the learning of gland internal. Next, we proposed a pseudo label filtering and reweighting mechanism, which filters and reweights the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model based on confidence. However, even after reweighting, the pseudo labels may still be influenced by unreliable pixels. Finally, we further designed an assistant predictor to learn the reweighted pseudo labels, which do not interfere with the student model's predictor and ensure the reliability of the student model's predictions. Experimental results on the publicly available GlaS and CRAG datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods.",,,

Dynamic Cognitive Diagnosis: An Educational Priors-Enhanced Deep Knowledge Tracing Perspective,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10065517/,"To provide personalized support on educational platforms, it is crucial to model the evolution of students' knowledge states. Knowledge tracing is one of the most popular technologies for this purpose, and deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Compared to classical models, such as Bayesian knowledge tracing, which track students' knowledge proficiencies, deep learning-based knowledge tracing is usually modeled to predict students' performances on questions, while ignoring the interpretability of students' knowledge states. However, for many practical applications, such as learning resource recommendation, it would be more helpful if we could explicitly track students' abilities or knowledge proficiencies separately from performance prediction. Researchers in psychometric area already designed cognitive diagnosis solutions to quantify the knowledge states of students in static conditions (e.g., examination), where the educational priors (i.e., factors related to students' learning process) were proved beneficial for student modeling. Inspired by this, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">dynamic cognitive diagnosis</i>, which integrates the interpretability of educational priors from cognitive diagnosis into deep learning-based knowledge tracing methods. We first discuss and provide evidence of which educational priors can be integrated, including question attributes and interaction function. Then we show the effects of using the educational priors in deep learning-based knowledge tracing from two aspects, i.e., interpretability and accuracy. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we prove that properly chosen priors can enable deep learning-based methods to evaluate students' knowledge states in a manner that is consistent with domain knowledge or human experience. Moreover, educational priors also improve the accuracy of student performance prediction.",,,

Enhancing Transfer Learning of LLMs through Fine- Tuning on Task - Related Corpora for Automated Short-Answer Grading,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10459755/,"Automated short-answer grading (ASAG) is a cru-cial element of any intelligent tutoring platform. Machine Learning (ML) has shown great promise for ASAG. However, this task remains challenging even for Deep Learning (DL) approaches and Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring semantic inference and textual entailment recognition. The SemEval-2013 Task 7, The Joint Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge, is a benchmark widely used for research on ASAG. The SciEntsBank data included in this collection contains nearly 11,000 answers to 197 assessment questions in 15 different science domains. Despite the popularity, only a few researchers have explored the potential of DL or LLMs for this task. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of the RoBERTa Large model, an LLM trained on an extensive text corpus for language comprehension. By fine-tuning the model on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) corpus for semantic inference and subsequently on the SciEntsBank dataset, with a focus on the 3-way labels of correct, incorrect, and contradictory, we achieved a weighted Fl-score of 0.77, 0.72, and 0.72 on unseen answers, questions, and domains, respectively. Notably, our model significantly benefits from fine-tuning on the MNLI corpus, particularly in enhancing its performance on the contradictory class (which constitutes only 10% of the dataset) through transfer learning leading to significant improvements on the more challenging test sets: unseen questions and unseen domains.",,,

Analyzing Classroom Behavior to Enhance Student Engagement and Learning Outcomes,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10895274/,"This research presents a high-tech smart system that utilizes video records to monitor student behavior in classroom settings and identify specific activities like raising hands and dozing. The uneven frequency of certain behaviors along with variances in student posture, seating arrangements, and video quality make it extremely difficult to identify these behaviors in a live classroom. While some behaviors, like raising one's hand, may happen frequently and in a variety of ways, others, like napping, may happen less frequently but are just as crucial to comprehending student engagement. We use a sizable annotated dataset, in which bounding boxes are constructed around significant objects of interest in the video frames, to get over these difficulties. Our system's core is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which we have specially tuned for behavior identification. The CNN model is made to quickly evaluate the visual data and recognize characteristics and patterns connected to certain student behaviors in real time.

Hence, this systematic literature review aims to investigate the state of the art of computer-aided nursing pedagogies in the post-COVID-19 era and provide recommendations for further research investigation. Specifically, it utilises a mixed methods approach to examine (1) the evolution of computer-aided nursing pedagogies before and after COVID-19; (2) their effectiveness against traditional methods in terms of knowledge, skills acquisition and self-efficiency; and (3) nursing students’ experiences and opinions when exposed to computer-aided nursing education pedagogies. For this purpose, several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Elite, IEEE, ACM, Scopus, ERIC and Cochrane Library (Controlled trial requests) were searched, initially retrieving 802 articles published between 2013-2023. After removing duplicates, exclusion criteria and assessment for eligibility, the number of articles assessed for eligibility was reduced to 78 conducted in 20 different countries. The articles comprised quantitative research (n=37), including Randomised Control Trials (n=14) and Quasi-experimental studies (n=23), and qualitative research (n=41) including observational studies (n=14), mixed-methods methodological design (n=15), pilot studies (n=7) and conference papers (n=5). Moreover, this SLR utilised the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological approach for conducting a mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) and provided a narrative synthesis of all studies. The results of this mixed-methods SLR suggested that the post-COVID-19 era has enabled the implementation of a variety of computerised systems in nursing education, including desktop-based systems, mobile applications, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and holograms, haptics, Artificial Intelligence-enabled chatbots and systems, smart glasses and multimodal systems. The authors found that these computer-aided nursing education pedagogies were superior to traditional nursing pedagogies regarding acquiring knowledge, skills, and self-efficiency. However, the generalisability of the above findings should be interpreted with caution due to variations in sample size and effect size established via Hedges’ g calculations among the 35 quantitative articles. Nevertheless, nursing students’ experiences and opinions were encouragingly positive. Further research is needed to incorporate more realistic and memorable scenarios and examine the effects of computer-aided nursing educational pedagogies on long-term knowledge gains and the effective learning domain.",,,
AI-Based Automatic Detection of Online Teamwork Engagement in Higher Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669806/,"Fostering productive engagement within teams has been found to improve student learning outcomes. Consequently, characterizing productive and unproductive time during teamwork sessions is a critical preliminary step to increase engagement in teamwork meetings. However, research from the cognitive sciences has mainly focused on characterizing levels of productive engagement. Thus, the theoretical contribution of this study focuses on characterizing active and passive forms of engagement, as well as negative and positive forms of engagement. In tandem, researchers have used computer-based methods to supplement quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate teamwork engagement. Yet, these studies have been limited to information extracted primarily from one data stream. For instance, text data from discussion forums or video data from recordings. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based automatic system that detects productive and unproductive engagement during live teamwork sessions. The technical contribution of this study focuses on the use of three data streams from an interactive session: audio, video, and text. We automatically analyze them and determine each team's level of engagement, such as productive engagement, unproductive engagement, disengagement, and idle. The AI-based system was validated based on hand-coded data. We used the system to characterize productive and unproductive engagement patterns in teams using deep learning methods. Results showed that there were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$>$</tex-math></inline-formula>91% prediction accuracy and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$< $</tex-math></inline-formula>7% mismatches between predictions for the three engagement detectors.

Evaluation of Handwritten Descriptive Responses Using Machine Learning - A Survey,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10425768/,"Evaluation of student performances is crucial to the process of learning in an education system. Currently, the most common approach adopted throughout the education industry is largely reliant on human resources as forms of evaluators. As the gap in student-teacher ratios increases, this process becomes complicated and cumbersome and such manual assessment techniques lead to unintentional biases and inconsistency. Technology has been playing a role in aiding evaluators in the recent trends. Instead of the traditional pen and paper-based methods, modes of assessments are being digitized and so are the correction processes. While there are several successful technologies available for grading multiple-choice questions, there is still growing research for methods of evaluating descriptive questions which need to account for a degree of variations in student answers. For the last few decades, there have been many researchers working on developing a system that would act as a bridge between traditional methods and digitized evaluation systems, by using techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Various Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques have been proposed to evaluate descriptive answers automatically. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of such systems and analyses the drawbacks of the current studies. It has been observed that these systems do not consider essay-type questions that do not have a defined answer.",,,

Learning path design on knowledge graph by using reinforcement learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386061/,"Designing an optimal learning path for specific tasks benefits learners and instructors in education. Many approaches adopt the individual knowledge elements to construct the learning path by question and answer. However, the current methods often fail to consider the relationship between knowledge elements. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning path design. More specifically, our method constructs a knowledge graph according to the concept relationship contained in exercises and formulates the RL framework with the predefined graph constraints. To achieve rewards in RL, the proposed formulation employs the deep knowledge tracing model for evaluation. With our formulation, we evaluated the classical RL models, including the Deep Q-network and its variants, to design the learning path. Finally, the simulated experiments are conducted on a public dataset for online education. Experimental results show that the introduced RL approach generates effective learning sequences to improve the correct probability of question answers.

Lightweight Configuration Adaptation With Multi-Teacher Reinforcement Learning for Live Video Analytics,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829727/,"The proliferation of video data and advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have greatly boosted live video analytics, driven by the growing video capture capabilities of mobile devices. However, resource limitations necessitate the transmission of endpoint-collected videos to servers for inference. To meet real-time requirements and ensure accurate inference, it is essential to adjust video configurations at the endpoint. Traditional methods rely on deterministic strategies, posing difficulties in adapting to dynamic networks and video content. Meanwhile, emerging learning-based schemes suffer from trial-and-error exploration mechanisms, resulting in a concerning long-tail effect on upload latency.

Positive psychology suggests that addressing negative emotions like loneliness requires fostering positive emotional experiences to build psychological resilience, rather than focusing solely on mitigating loneliness itself. Although previous research has demonstrated that activities such as travel and video games can improve positive emotions among students, these interventions are often hindered by high costs and potential adverse effects. In this context, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of an anthropomorphic virtual learning assistant (VLA) on students' positive emotions. Drawing on anthropomorphism and empathy theories, the study introduces empathy as a mediating variable and loneliness as a moderating factor. The findings indicate that the anthropomorphic VLA, in contrast to nonanthropomorphic designs, significantly enhances positive emotions by promoting empathy, particularly among students with higher levels of loneliness.

An Inquirer-Responder Architecture Using LLMs: Emulating Virtual Hearing Q&A in Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10350078/,"This paper presents an Inquirer-Responder architecture consisting of multiple LLM instances and applies it to a method for automatically generating feedback comments on student reports by emulating virtual hearing Q&A. This method uses faculty education materials and student reports as inputs for multiple LLM instances. In education, quickly returning personalized feedback to each student is crucial but burdensome for faculty. The implementation of a system that automatically and promptly returns feedback on student submissions can improve student learning efficiency and reduce the faculty workload. Our proposed architecture consists of two LLM instances, referred to as inquirer and responder. The inquirer is an LLM instance that reads the material (e.g., lecture materials) provided by the faculty, poses questions, and evaluates the responses from the responder. The responder is an LLM instance that reads student submissions (e.g., reports) and answers questions posed by the inquirer based on the contents of those submissions. This architecture uses faculty materials and student submissions to emulate a virtual hearing, with evaluation based on the knowledge extracted from both the faculty materials and student submissions. This architecture can be applied to various systems that automatically and quickly check submissions and return feedback. In this study, we established a hypothetical use case for a university class and conducted experiments. As a result, there were some cases in which the evaluation was difficult owing to the performance of the current LLM. However, the proposed architecture provides a new perspective on the design of automatic feedback systems and is a step toward their improvement.",,,
Cyclic Data Distillation Semi-Supervised Learning for Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049910/,"Multi-modal emotion recognition (MER) integrates multi-modal signals to help computers comprehensively understand human emotions, which is a crucial technology in human-computer interactions. However, the amount of labeled multi-modal emotion data is small and limits MER performance due to its expensive manual annotations. Meanwhile, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods improving MER models with enormous unlabeled data suffer from confirmation bias, resulting in biased data distribution. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a cyclic data distillation semi-supervised learning (CDD-SSL) for MER tasks. CDD-SSL leverages multiple pre-trained unimodal teacher models and confidence-boosting pseudo-labelling (CBPL) to boost the confidence of multi-modal ensemble outputs and distill reliable and class-representative data from numerous unlabeled data. It then utilizes reliable and less-biased data to train a multi-modal student model and provides feedback to update all unimodal teacher models. CDD-SSL is a cyclic teacher-student framework with a feedback mechanism that gradually mitigates confirmation bias and obtains an effective MER model. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDD-SSL achieves superior performance over both the semi-supervised methods and the state-of-the-art fully-supervised models in MER tasks.",,,

A Pilot Study of Probing Before Trusting Large Language Models in Self-Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113570/,"A critical and general problem of large language models (LLMs) is that they may hallucinate, generating specious answers, especially when they interpret certain concepts expressed in the given natural language queries using incorrect (sub)domain knowledge they possess. Still, LLMs are widely used by people. To embrace LLMs in education, students can adopt them to seek quick feedback on their questions to enhance their inquisitive approaches to self-learning, while there is a guard against hallucination. This paper introduces DomainProbe, the first approach to domain-level hallucination detection that leverages metamorphic testing for addressing the test oracle problem to improve the trustworthiness of the feedback generated by LLMs. Given a question posed by a student, DomainProbe prompts the LLM to extract key topical terms from the question and provide explanations for each. The student then evaluates whether there is any inconsistent term-explanation pair. If such an inconsistency is identified, the corresponding answer for the question from the LLM is flagged as untrustworthy. We show DomainProbe to achieve promising results by evaluating it on MMLU, a widely used question-answer benchmark dataset. We further discuss our vision on the approach to promote students' learning objectives and outline future work for the metamorphic relations formulated in DomainProbe.",,,

The usage of this mechanism has brought many exciting areas of study, from the design of questions to the ML grading tools’ precision and accuracy. This paper analyzes the findings of 125 studies published in journals and proceedings between 2016 and 2020 on the usages of automatic scoring and feedback as a learning tool. This analysis gives an overview of the trends, challenges, and open questions in this research area. The results indicate that automatic scoring and feedback have many advantages. The most important benefits include enabling scaling the number of students without adding a proportional number of instructors, improving the student experience by reducing the time between submission grading and feedback, and removing bias in scoring.

Therein, we propose a novel algorithm-independent knowledge distillation algorithm for online RL agents, by leveraging pre-trained models and the interface between agents and the environment to transfer distilled knowledge among multiple heterogeneous agents efficiently. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm can accelerate the convergence of various online agents in a double to decuple speed, with comparable reward achieved in different environments.",,,
WIP: Innovative Practice: Incorporating ChatGPT into Technical Writing Assignments in Chemical Engineering Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892836/,"This work in progress (WIP) innovative practice paper describes the incorporation of ChatGPT into technical writing at the undergraduate and graduate level of an engineering program. Since professional skills play a critical role in the success of an engineer, specifically communication through writing, it is critical to incorporate writing into the curriculum; however, large class sizes, overloaded faculty, and the qualitative aspect of writing, can make it difficult to convince faculty to do so. The rise of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Conversational Agents (AI-DCA) that can understand and respond to human language and give immediate feedback could aid in resolving this challenge. To understand the students' perceptions of using AI platforms for revisions, a homework assignment in both a graduate and undergraduate course incorporated the use of ChatGPT for editing and creation. Then, a survey that included their likes and concerns about using AI for educational purposes was given. The preliminary results found that many students had never used ChatGPT, and that they were impressed with its ability to correct grammar mistakes and assist in making sentences more concise. While the majority of both graduate and undergraduate students found value in the changes that ChatGPT suggested, concerns regarding ethics, accuracy, and the use of AI in general were mentioned. Although the setting for this innovative practice was within the context of chemical engineering education, the principles can be applied to other disciplines as well. Motivations for adopting this practice include the desire to improve student writing skills, increase engagement and accessibility, and better prepare students for future careers in industry.",,,

A Mobile Application-Based Solution for Identifying Accessibility Challenges in Various Physical Classroom Designs at a U.S. Midwestern University,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126455/,"In contemporary education, ensuring classroom accessibility is fundamental to fostering equitable learning opportunities for all students. Despite advancements in inclusive education, students with disabilities continue to encounter substantial barriers that hinder their academic progress. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 24.8% of U.S. adults have a disability, with 12% of graduate students reporting similar challenges [1]. In 2022, approximately 15% of college students disclosed having ADD or ADHD; however, a significant proportion (15-43%) of students who disclose disabilities do not receive necessary accommodations [1][2][3][4]. These statistics underscore the urgent need for a systematic approach to assessing and improving classroom accessibility. To address this challenge, researchers developed a mobile application to audit classroom accessibility. The application incorporates structured questionnaires that evaluate physical classroom accessibility, generating a quantitative accessibility score based on user responses. This score provides data-driven insights into the inclusivity of classroom environments, enabling educational institutions to identify and address accessibility barriers. The application, compatible with both iOS and Android platforms, facilitates real-time feedback collection from students, educators, and staff.

Adaptive Multi-Modal CNN Framework for Intelligent Evaluation of Ideological and Political Classroom Teaching in Higher Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168709/,"Evaluation of ideological and political course teaching quality in colleges and universities is of great importance to improve educational achievements and comprehensive development of students. The traditional evaluation approaches are largely based on subjective judgments, manual observation, and scarce data sources, which may cause inconsistencies and insufficient timely feedback. Current automated systems usually center on single-modal data, like video or audio analysis, and end up lacking a proper understanding of intricate classroom dynamics. To overcome these constraints, this study suggests an Adaptive Multi-Modal CNN-Attention Hybrid Model for intelligent assessment of ideological and political classroom instruction.

Neuroeducation for Efficient Mathematics Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11025051/,"Mental calculation can enhance cognitive processes involved in problem solving, cognitive flexibility, and other meta-competencies. Notwithstanding, its application is scarce in higher education. Current research examined mental calculation from and neuroeducational perspective, aiming to enhance the learning of mathematics. Over three semesters, we implemented an activity called “mental agility” (AG) with 157 engineering undergraduates in a Mexican private university. It consisted of 10 question sets designed to reinforce mathematical concepts and to be solved within 10 min or less. The questions were read to the students and only the final answer was evaluated; no procedure was required. We gathered data on students' perceptions by employing surveys and interviews. A mixed analysis evidenced that students perceive AG as challenging and dynamic, motivating self-study and improving concept understanding. Quick feedback on their performance was fundamental to impact students' emotional engagement. Besides emotions, AG mobilizes reasoning, long-term memory, and decision-making which, according to neuroscience, are the four conditions to trigger learning.

Weakly Supervised Framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on Students’ Reviews of MOOCs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9110884/,"Students' feedback is an effective mechanism that provides valuable insights about teaching-learning process. Handling opinions of students expressed in reviews is a quite labour-intensive and tedious task as it is typically performed manually by the human intervention. While this task may be viable for small-scale courses that involve just a few students' feedback, it is unpractical for large-scale cases as it applies to online courses in general, and MOOCs, in particular. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose in this paper a framework to automatically analyzing opinions of students expressed in reviews. Specifically, the framework relies on aspect-level sentiment analysis and aims to automatically identify sentiment or opinion polarity expressed towards a given aspect related to the MOOC. The proposed framework takes advantage of weakly supervised annotation of MOOC-related aspects and propagates the weak supervision signal to effectively identify the aspect categories discussed in the unlabeled students' reviews. Consequently, it significantly reduces the need for manually annotated data which is the main bottleneck for all deep learning techniques. A large-scale real-world education dataset containing around 105k students' reviews collected from Coursera and a dataset comprising of 5989 students' feedback in traditional classroom settings are used to perform experiments. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework attains inspiring performance with respect to both the aspect category identification and the aspect sentiment classification. Moreover, the results suggest that the framework leads to more accurate results than the expensive and labour-intensive sentiment analysis techniques relying heavily on manually labelled data.",,,

Unlike traditional face-to-face learning, online learning exhibits a critical limitation: real-time interactions between learners and teachers are generally not feasible in online learning. To overcome this issue, we implemented an online learning system based on electroencephalography (EEG)-based passive brain-computer interface technology referred to as the “adaptive neuro-learning system (ANLS).” It monitors the current mental states of learners seamlessly using EEG signals. Then, it adaptively provides natural and interactive video feedback rather than simple alarms or pop quizzes following the current mental conditions of a learner. In this article, a total of 60 university students were assigned randomly to one of four groups: two experimental groups, for which either ANLS based on attention state estimation or ANLS based on both attention and comprehension states estimation was tested, and two control groups, the students in which were taught using either the conventional online lecture without feedback or an online course with randomized video feedbacks.

Toward Human–AI Collaboration: A Recommender System to Support CS1 Instructors to Select Problems for Assignments and Exams,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9961911/,"Programming online judges (POJs) have been increasingly used in CS1 classes, as they allow students to practice and get quick feedback. For instructors, it is a useful tool for creating assignments and exams. However, selecting problems in POJs is time consuming. First, problems are generally not organized based on topics covered in the CS1 syllabus. Second, assessing whether problems require similar effort to be completed and map onto the same topic is a subjective and expert-dependent task. The difficulty increases if the instructor must create variations of these assessments, e.g., to avoid plagiarism. Thus, here, we research how to support CS1 instructors in the task of selecting problems, to compose one-size-fits-all or personalized assignments/exams. Our solution is to propose a novel intelligent recommender system, based on a fine-grained data-driven analysis of the students' effort on solving problems in the integrated development environment of a POJ system, and automatic detection of topics for CS1 problems, based on problem descriptions. Data collected from 2714 students are processed to support, via our artificial intelligence (AI) method recommendations, the instructors' decision-making process. We evaluated our method against the state of the art in a simple blind experiment with CS1 instructors (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N =$</tex-math></inline-formula> 35).

Enhancing Medical Training Through Learning From Mistakes by Interacting With an Ill-Trained Reinforcement Learning Agent,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458319/,"This article presents a 3-D medical simulation that employs reinforcement learning (RL) and interactive RL (IRL) to teach and assess the procedure of donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). The simulation is motivated by the need for effective, safe, and remote training techniques in medicine, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The simulation has two modes: a tutorial mode and an assessment mode. In the tutorial mode, a computer-based, ill-trained RL agent utilizes RL to learn the correct sequence of donning the PPE by trial and error. This allows students to experience many outlier cases they might not encounter in an in-class educational model. In the assessment mode, an IRL-based method is used to evaluate how effective the participant is at correcting the mistakes performed by the RL agent. Each time the RL agent interacts with the environment and performs an action, the participants provide positive or negative feedback regarding the action taken. Following the assessment, participants receive a score based on the accuracy of their feedback and the time taken for the RL agent to learn the correct sequence. An experiment was conducted using two groups, each consisting of ten participants. The first group received RL-assisted training for donning PPE, followed by an IRL-based assessment. Meanwhile, the second group observed a video featuring the RL agent demonstrating only the correct donning order without outlier cases, replicating traditional training, before undergoing the same assessment as the first group. Results showed that RL-assisted training with many outlier cases was more effective than traditional training with only regular cases. Moreover, combining RL with IRL significantly enhanced the participants' performance. Notably, 90% of the participants finished the assessment with perfect scores within three iterations. In contrast, only 10% of those who did not engage in RL-assisted training finished the assessment with a perfect score, highlighting the substantial impact of RL and IRL integration on participants’ overall achievement.",,,
Analyzing Student Ethical Perception on ChatGPT Usage in Indonesian Higher Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10942198/,"This study explores the ethical implications and factors influencing ChatGPT adoption in Indonesian higher education. Indonesia presently leads Southeast Asia in ChatGPT usage due to younger generations who are quick to adopt new technology into their daily life. ChatGPT's growing role in education has resulted in numerous benefits, such as intelligent tutoring systems, personalized help, and adaptable learning experiences that have reshaped the learning process. However, students may become overly dependent on this tool, which could undermine the goal of education by weakening higher-level cognitive abilities like creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking. This research, therefore, set out to evaluate students' knowledge, attitudes, perspectives, concerns, and ethical considerations around ChatGPT usage. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected via an online questionnaire from 512 student respondents and analysed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that four of the five proposed hypotheses were supported and revealed that knowledge of ChatGPT has no significant impact on its usage, whereas students' attitudes did play a critical role.

Problem Solving-Oriented Programming Knowledge Tracing from Behavior to Thought,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10889146/,"Programming knowledge tracing (programming KT) aims to analyze the dynamic programming states in solving problems based on historical behaviors and predict future performance. In programming, a student’s thought process can lead to multiple solutions for the same problem. However, current programming KT models attribute learners’ responses only to knowledge mastery and ability, overlooking thought factors, which creates a contradiction between data fitting and the rationalization of the model inference process. To address this, we propose a problem solving-oriented programming KT (SPKT) method that incorporates programming knowledge, computational thinking, and solving ability to improve attribution accuracy. Specifically, we designed a dual-channel attention network based on the principle of initiative gain to retrieve knowledge. Additionally, we utilized the edit tree distance algorithm to capture fine-grained trajectory representations and employed a redress mechanism with gating to update abilities based on code information. Experiments demonstrate SPKT’s superiority.",,,

Students with better communication skills are academically and technically smart, they communicate and understand their colleagues which creates a holistic work/study environment. The four main divisions of communication skills are LSRW (Listening, speaking, reading and writing). Each and every division is directly or indirectly dependent on each other. Improving these four skills are essential in today’s world. To foster these skills a new model has been proposed which is backed by AI (Artificial Intelligence). After each skill module this model tests a student’s communication skills and generates feedback which shows the interpretation level of the student. This data is given to an AI model which generates questions according to the understanding of each student. Each student gets a unique set of questions according to his/her understanding and interpretation skills. This model coerces a student to engage in advancing their communication skills. It strengthens one’s knowledge in each and every aspect of the communication skill as it has speaking and listening exercises incorporated in it.

Automatic Delineation of the 3D Left Atrium From LGE-MRI: Actor-Critic Based Detection and Semi-Supervised Segmentation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10459346/,"Accurate and automatic delineation of the left atrium (LA) is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis of atrial fibrillation-related diseases. However, effective model training typically requires a large amount of labeled data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel LA delineation framework. The region of LA is first detected using an actor-critic based deep reinforcement learning method with a shape-adaptive detection strategy using only box-level annotations, bypassing the need for voxel-level labeling. With the effectively detected LA, the impacts of class-imbalance and interference from surrounding tissues are significantly reduced. Subsequently, a semi-supervised segmentation scheme is coined to precisely delineate the contour of LA in 3D volume. The scheme integrates two independent networks with distinct structures, enabling implicit consistency regularization, capturing more spatial features, and avoiding the error accumulation present in current mainstream semi-supervised frameworks. Specifically, one network is combined with Transformer to capture latent spatial features, while the other network is based on pure CNN to capture local features. The difference prediction between these two sub-networks is exploited to mutually provide high-quality pseudo-labels and correct the cognitive bias. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed strategy outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and clinical convenience.",,,

However, owing to the growing scale and heterogeneity of the networks, energy-efficient resource allocation in heterogeneous MEC (Het-MEC) networks faces great challenges. As an emerging research area, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is expected to realize autonomous resource allocation in Het-MEC networks by learning from trial and error. Nevertheless, existing MADRL-based solutions are usually not applicable to practical scenarios by the limitations of centralized control schemes or massive signaling overhead. To address the issue, we first formulate the energy-efficient resource allocation problem in Het-MEC networks as a time-variant mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Then, we propose a fully decentralized collaborative MADRL-based algorithm featuring the multi-actor shared-critic (MASC) architecture and the regional training distributed execution (RTDE) framework, which effectively stabilizes model training and reduces information exchange, respectively.

Hybrid Student Authentication System Using RFID Reader and Face Biometrics Using Deep Learning Techniques,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9792810/,"Every school, college, and university maintains a record of each student's attendance. Faculty are required to retain accurate and current attendance records. Because it takes a long time to organize records and determine each student's average attendance, the manual attendance record system is inefficient. As a result, a system for organizing student records and calculating average attendance is required The proposed system should be able to save student attendance records in digital format, making attendance management easier. Even in the twenty-firs t century, students' attendance is recorded on attendance forms presented in the classroom by staff members, which takes time and is completely manual. Despite the fact that RFID-based and face recognition-based systems have been shown, they are implemented separately. A RFID reader is integrated with a Face recognition system in the suggested system for student attendance.

NeuroTutor: Neural Decoding of Student Engagement During Virtual and Robotic Tutoring,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071325/,"The use of electroencephalography (EEG)-based analysis in educational research offers valuable insight into the dynamics of virtual and robot-based tutoring systems. This study aims to classify neural patterns associated with two distinct tutoring modalities (virtual tutor versus robot tutor) to understand how different educational interfaces affect brain activity and engagement biomarkers. This classification enables adaptive learning systems that can optimize educational environments based on real-time neural responses, potentially enhancing learning outcomes by matching tutoring modalities to individual neural preferences. We examine the performance of multiple EEG features such as power spectral density, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude coefficients, amplitude and variance, coherence, Hjorth parameters, and wavelet transform coefficients in distinguishing between these two tutoring modalities. A transformer-based binary classifier was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of these characteristics in classifying EEG data collected during interactions with both types of tutors. The wavelet transform coefficients demonstrated the highest classification accuracy of 98.75%, precision of 99.17%, recall of 98.18%, F1 score of 98.61%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1.00, indicating exceptional performance in all metrics.

Using GPT-4 to Tutor Python Programming in Shona and Ndebele in Zimbabwe,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779794/,"In many post-Colonial African countries, English is the medium of instruction at schools and universities. Many, if not most of the students, however, are not home language English speakers. In the specific situation of Zimbabwe, approximately eighty percent of the population is Shona speaking and approximately ten percent of the population is Ndebele speaking. Existing research shows that when learners or students are forced to learn technical subjects (such as mathematics and computer programming) in their non-home language, they are doing double work. Not only do they need to learn the new subject domain, they also need to translate these new terms to and from their home language. This paper investigates the use of an GPT-4 based artificially intelligent tutoring bot configured to tutor the subject of Python Programming in both Shona and Ndebele. This paper is the first step of a multi-step research project which has the final goal of helping Zimbabwean learners and students learn Python Programming in their home language.

A capstone project is a feature of most undergraduate programs in computer engineering. Such a project is usually meant to expose students to the development of a large system from conceptualization to its final implementation, involving substantial design and development of hardware and software components. In our university, students were given the opportunity to work on a cutting-edge problem focused on healthcare - “Designing a wearable device that automatically detects human activities”. It is an area where a large amount of research is ongoing, and hundreds of scientific papers are published every year. In addition, students had to evaluate and adopt techniques from existing literature and adapt them to meet the problem requirements. Students equipped themselves with state-of-the-art hardware, Bio-signal processing, machine learning, power optimization and secure communications to design the wearable. Thus, the project reinforced their knowledge of fundamentals, while exposing them to a problem with no obvious solution. Through the capstone project, students are able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the computer engineering curriculum to large-scale computer engineering projects. Students are organized into teams of six to execute the project. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the university migrating the teaching online for all courses. This was particularly challenging to implement for the capstone project as one of the key requirements is for the members to work together and subsystems to interact with each other. A course refresh resulted in a credits update and this provided a unique opportunity for the teaching team to re-design the project with core Industry 4.0 technologies such as hardware acceleration, remote processing, networking, remote analytics, and secure protocols. This work presents a framework for its implementation, reviews the challenges encountered and the processes put in place to ensure data security and smooth running of the project in the event of future disruptions. Quantitative and qualitative results from the course feedback surveys are analyzed to gauge student response to the implementation and compared to the previous version.",,,

CQACD: A Concept Question-Answering System for Intelligent Tutoring Using a Domain Ontology With Rich Semantics,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9802991/,"In this study, a Concept Question Answering system applied to the Computer Domain (CQACD) for intelligent tutoring is proposed. This system is a dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that allows the tutor and student with mixed-initiative and natural language to ask each other questions concerning the basic computer knowledge in the <italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Computer Basics</i> course. CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can.

Designing an Artificial Agent for Cognitive Apprenticeship Learning of Elevator Pitch in Virtual Reality,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9409128/,"Developing social skills like elevator pitch requires being situated within authentic activities and contexts, which is difficult to achieve on a daily basis. In this work, we explore whether an artificial agent with embodied feedback in virtual reality (VR) can foster a situated learning experience. Previous works on computer-mediated feedback have shown that VR can foster oral presentation competence for preuniversity and junior undergraduates through delivering feedback. However, it is unclear how well the learning experiences are and how well students perceive an artificial coach in VR, especially for senior undergraduates and postgraduates seeking job and research opportunities. To inform the design of such a system, we conducted interviews with experts and observed real elevator pitches. We then designed a proof-of-concept VR coaching system with three embodied feedback strategies: immediate, after-action, and the combination of both. Through a between-subject experiment with 40 participants, we studied learners’ perceptions under the embodied feedback. We found that receiving embodied feedback can create a stronger sense of cognitive apprenticeship, i.e., coaching and helping from experts, and help improve the perception of the artificial agent and the effect of learning. We further investigated the pros and cons of different strategies and discussed room for improvement.",,,

Student Mastery or AI Deception? Analyzing ChatGPT's Assessment Proficiency and Evaluating Detection Strategies,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10590238/,"Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT have a disruptive effect on learning and assessment. Computer science requires practice to develop skills in problem solving and programming that are traditionally developed using assignments. Generative AI has the capability of completing these assignments for students with high accuracy, which dramatically increases the potential for academic integrity issues and students not achieving desired learning outcomes. This work investigates the performance of ChatGPT by evaluating it across three courses (CS1,CS2,databases). ChatGPT completes almost all introductory assessments perfectly. Existing detection methods, such as MOSS and JPlag (based on similarity metrics) and GPTzero (AI detection), have mixed success in identifying AI solutions. Evaluating instructors and teaching assistants using heuristics to distinguish between student and AI code shows that their detection is not sufficiently accurate. These observations emphasize the need for adapting assessments and improved detection methods.",,,

An immersive situational group learning system with body movement and emotion recognition combined with subject knowledge,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9853776/,"In the current digital situational learning, such as digital game-based learning or Second Life, learners use virtual characters to enter the situational learning, instead of using their own bodies. In addition, many subject matters requiring situational learning need a combination of subject knowledge, body language, and emotional expression, and require students to conduct group learning. However, most of the current situational systems can only provide evaluation and feedback on text or language, and cannot provide feedback on body movements and emotional expressions. To address these issues, this study establishes a situational learning system that enables students to enter the learning situation with their whole body and in small groups. Furthermore, the cognitive services of artificial intelligence are also adopted to conduct immediate evaluation and feedback on students’ learning performance, such as language, body movement, and emotional display, and students’ learning outcomes can be displayed in front of their peers. The experimental results show that the proposed situational learning system can improve students’ learning effect for subject matters that need to combine body movements and emotional expression.",,,

Interactive E-Learning Environment for Cognitive Robotics,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10578630/,"While robots are increasingly present in everyday environments as vacuum cleaners, lawnmowers, or voice assistants, cognitive robots that autonomously help the elderly, prepare meals, do the laundry, or clean up are still missing. This is due to various reasons. Besides such robots being less cost-efficient, needing more knowledge, and the ability to safely perform task variations in changing environments, successful research applications are rarely adopted by industry. Although there are robots that already are able to prepare meals, clean the table, or fold the laundry, these applications cannot easily be implemented by someone who is not familiar with the available robots, their cognitive architecture, and their knowledge framework. In order to help more people get familiar with robotics, reuse existing infrastructure in simulation environments, and implement their own applications on this basis, we propose an immersive E-Learning environment for Cognitive Robotics that not only introduces and describes the different aspects needed for developing robotic applications, but also offers easy-to-use tutorials on how to program robots that are based on simulation environments that link to the different software modules a robot needs to execute actions. We define a set of competences for Cognitive Robotics that covers the required content-related and process-related competences. We present the underlying didactical approaches such as APKIPE (Ger.

Interpretable Knowledge Tracing via Response Influence-based Counterfactual Reasoning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598094/,"Knowledge tracing (KT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems, aiming to assess students' knowledge proficiency by predicting their future performance on new questions based on their past response records. While existing deep learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) methods have significantly improved prediction accuracy and achieved state-of-the-art results, they often suffer from a lack of interpretability. To address this limitation, current approaches have explored incorporating psychological influences to achieve more explainable predictions, but they tend to overlook the potential influences of historical responses. In fact, understanding how models make predictions based on response influences can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of the knowledge tracing process, presenting an opportunity for a new paradigm of interpretable KT. However, measuring unobservable response influences is challenging. In this paper, we resort to counterfactual reasoning that intervenes in each response to answer what if a student had answered a question incorrectly that he/she actually answered correctly, and vice versa. Based on this, we propose RCKT, a novel response influence-based counterfactual knowledge tracing framework. RCKT generates response influences by comparing prediction outcomes from factual sequences and constructed counterfactual sequences after interventions. Additionally, we introduce maximization and inference techniques to leverage accumulated influences from different past responses, further improving the model's performance and credibility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RCKT method outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four datasets against six baselines, and provides credible interpretations of response influences.

SynFMPL: A Federated Meta Pseudo Labeling Framework with Synergetic Strategy,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278862/,"Recently, Google proposed a privacy-preserving framework, Federated Learning (FL), to realize the era of edge intelligence. However, the limited labeled data that can only be labeled by the data owner with domain know-how threatens the feasibility of FL. In fact, Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) is a key to leveraging the unlabeled data on the client side while the confirmation bias issue triggered by incorrect predictions in the old-fashion Teacher-Student structure drops the model accuracy significantly. In this paper, we introduce the state-of-the-art SSL technique called Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL), which advocates a feedback strategy in the Teacher-Student architecture to mitigate the performance degradation. Unfortunately, in FL the heterogeneous data without sharing among clients are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). The knowledge that shuttles between the Teacher and Student model may be partial and undermine the effectiveness of MPL. To make a performance breakthrough, we proposed a novel FL framework called Federated Meta Learning with Synergetic Strategy (SynFMPL), which combines the advantages of both Teacher and Student models. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that integrates MPL technique in FL. Moreover, we specifically focus on the client side, which fully leverages the unlabeled data for model generalization. The experiment shows that SynFPML outperforms all baselines in various non-IID scenarios. The Student model in SynFMPL even exceeds the upper bound in all baselines by 4% and maintains a virtuous cycle in the learning process.",,,

Enhancing Reliability and User Experience in Conversational Agents,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308922/,"Conversational agents are in place in a variety of domains and tasks such as sales and customer support services in business, student counselling in education and medical services in healthcare. There is abundant data available for modelling dialogs because online chat has been a popular way of communication between humans already for several decades. There are also innumerable other valuable digital resources that can be exploited when building a conversational agent, including pretrained large language models. We tested and evaluated several ways of preprocessing and modelling of chat dialogs in Finnish. As a result, we found out that the best accuracy is achieved using uncasing and spell-checking in the preprocessing phase and a BERT model pretrained with Finnish in the modelling phase. Despite the extensive use of conversational agents, there are still many open research questions. One example is the effect of the interaction style of the agent on user experience and emotions. Our initial study suggests that chatbots including small talk are less likely to elicit negative emotions, whereby emojis and emotional statements issued by chatbots do not play a significant role on the user’s emotional responses. We also discuss how medical expert work may be partially automated and made more interesting as input for routine conversation is handled by a chatbot.

Reinforcement Learning-Driven Optimization of Picture Book Paths for Aesthetic Perception Enhancement,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129920/,"Aesthetic perception, as a core competence in art education, fosters students’ cultural sensibility, emotional expression, and critical thinking. However, existing approaches to cultivating aesthetic perception often lack systematic guidance and personalized developmental pathways, limiting their capacity to support sustained and individualized growth. Two central challenges remain unresolved: first, how to effectively model the dynamic, multidimensional progression of students’ aesthetic understanding, and second, how to construct coherent learning paths that guide students from basic perceptual awareness to more abstract artistic engagement. To address these issues, we propose AesthPath a reinforcement learning-based recommendation model that constructs personalized picture book learning paths to enhance aesthetic perception. Specifically, the model introduces a Markov decision process formulation that captures the evolving states of learners’ aesthetic competence across multiple dimensions. An actor–critic algorithm is then employed to generate adaptive learning trajectories by balancing exploration of new content with the reinforcement of effective materials, based on ongoing learner feedback. Unlike traditional static or rule-based recommendation methods, AesthPath supports fine-grained, feedback-driven optimization of learning trajectories, facilitating goal-oriented and personalized development of aesthetic perception. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AesthPath in enhancing students’ aesthetic understanding. This study offers new theoretical and methodological insights for intelligent learning path design and educational recommendations, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning in adaptive learning scenarios.",,,

Knowledge Tracing Model Integrating Question Text Content and Cross-Level Contrastive Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11108936/,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) has garnered significant attention in the field of education, aiming to analyze learners' historical interaction records to dynamically track their current knowledge states and predict their future learning performance. Most existing KT models primarily rely on question IDs or concept IDs as the main features, neglecting question text content as a potential key feature. This limits the models' ability to learn semantic information from questions, ultimately affecting their predictive performance and accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel model: the Knowledge Tracing Model Integrating Question Text Content and Cross-Level Contrastive Learning (QCKT). First, the model employs the BERT method to encode question text content, capturing its contextual semantic information and dependency relationships. Next, a textual attention mechanism module is introduced, enabling the model to dynamically adjust the importance of individual words to better focus on critical information in the questions. Finally, a cross-level contrastive learning module is designed to unify multi-level embedding features of question IDs and question text content within a shared embedding space, thereby optimizing the relationships between these features and enhancing the model's representation capability. Additionally, various data augmentation strategies are employed to increase data diversity, further improving the model's generalization and robustness. To evaluate the performance of the QCKT model, experiments were conducted on two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing KT models, QCKT achieves significant improvements in AUC scores, with increases of 2.21% and 0.85% on the respective datasets. This highlights its superior predictive capability, which indicates its considerable potential for accurately assessing students' learning states and providing personalized instructional recommendations.",,,

Clustering Entity Relationship Diagrams: Enhancing Feedback Quality and Grading Consistency in Large Database Courses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893428/,"This innovative practice full paper introduces a tool for clustering Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and explores its application in large classes. ERDs are fundamental for database design in courses related to databases, data science, and software engineering. However, processing ERD homework submissions in large classes poses significant challenges due to the variety of design decisions made by students, leading to numerous diagram variations. This paper presents an ERD clustering tool designed to group similar ERD submissions, aiding instructors and teaching assistants in identifying popular solutions and common mistakes. The tool employs advanced object detection, OCR, and clustering technologies. We evaluated the tool using four datasets from two large public U.S. universities, with submissions ranging from 130 to 430 diagrams. Various clustering methodologies were assessed, highlighting the importance of incorporating ERD structure into the clustering process. Our findings indicate that the tool successfully generated adequate clusters, and that aiming for 10 clusters is appropriate regardless of the dataset size. The generated clusters included common approaches and mistakes, proving helpful for providing feedback and simplifying the grading process.",,,
Visual Teaching Design of Compile Principle Based on JFLAP,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9534590/,"The course of compile principle is characterized by abstract theory and complex algorithm. It is relatively difficult for students to understand, which makes the effect of theoretical teaching poor. Therefore, the visual teaching tool JFLAP is introduced into the theoretical teaching of this course. For the difficulties of students’ feedback, this paper takes SLR (1) parsing as an example. In order to make full use of the visualization function of JFLAP, this paper presents a visual demonstration of the whole process of SLR (1) parsing, including calculation of FIRST set and FOLLOW set, construction of DFA, creation of parsing table and analysis of specific string.

Construction of a Higher Vocational Culinary Education Quality Evaluation Model for University–Industry Integration Based on Adaptive BP and DDAE-SVR,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143177/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of computer science, the integration of advanced computational techniques into interdisciplinary domains has become paramount. This study addresses the critical need for robust evaluation models in vocational education, emphasizing the synergy between academic institutions and industry partnerships. Traditional assessment methods in culinary education often rely on static metrics such as student grades, attendance rates, and standardized test scores. These metrics fail to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of culinary skills, which require the integration of both practical hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge. The challenges in culinary education include continuously adapting to changing industry trends, varying student learning styles, and the demand for real-time industry-relevant skills, which traditional methods do not adequately assess. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative evaluation framework that leverages Adaptive Evaluation Strategy for Educational Quality (AESEQ) and An Adaptive Attribution Strategy (AQAN). This model is designed to dynamically adjust to the evolving educational landscape, effectively capturing both quantitative and qualitative indicators of educational quality. The integration of DDAE enhances the model’s ability to manage complex, high-dimensional data, while the SVR component ensures precise predictive analytics. By incorporating deep feature extraction with noise reduction mechanisms, the model achieves greater generalization capability across diverse educational scenarios. Empirical validation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models in accuracy and reliability, offering a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to assess and enhance educational outcomes. This research contributes to the broader discourse on digital education within computer science, showcasing the transformative potential of computational methods in educational assessment and informing future policy and practice in data-driven educational reform.",,,
"Misconceptions, Pragmatism, and Value Tensions: Evaluating Students' Understanding and Perception of Generative AI for Education",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893017/,"In this research paper we examine undergraduate students' use of and perceptions of generative AI (GenAI). Although the initial hype around ChatGPT has subsided, GenAI applications continue to make inroads across learning activities. Like any other emerging technology, there is a lack of consensus around using GenAI within higher education. Students are early adopters of the technology, utilizing it in atypical ways and forming a range of perceptions and aspirations about it. To understand where and how students are using these tools and how they view them, we present findings from an open-ended survey response study with undergraduate students pursuing information technology degrees. Students were asked to describe 1) their understanding of GenAI; 2) their use of GenAI; 3) their opinions on the benefits, downsides, and ethical issues pertaining to its use in education; and 4) how they envision GenAI could ideally help them with their education. Thirty-seven students provided responses ranging in length from 20 to 300 words for each question. Responses were iteratively coded by researchers to uncover patterns in the data and then categorized thematically. Findings reveal that students' definitions of GenAI differed substantially and included many misconceptions - some highlight it as a technique, an application, or a tool, while others described it as a type of AI. There was a wide variation in the use of GenAI by students, with two common uses being writing and coding. They identified the ability of GenAI to summarize information and its potential to personalize learning as an advantage. Students identified two primary ethical concerns with using GenAI: plagiarism and dependency, which means that students do not learn independently. They also cautioned that responses from GenAI applications are often untrustworthy and need verification. Overall, they appreciated that they could do things quickly with GenAI but were cautious as using the technology was not necessarily in their best long-term as it interfered with the learning process. In terms of aspirations for GenAI, students expressed both practical advantages and idealistic and improbable visions. They said it could serve as a tutor or coach and allow them to understand the material better. We discuss the implications of the findings for student learning and instruction.",,,
“Thanks for the Practice!”: LLM-Powered Social Robot as Tandem Language Partner at University,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973837/,"Large language models (LLMs), when integrated into social robots, have the potential to transform robot-assisted language learning by offering personalized, interactive communication. However, there is limited research exploring their potential to simultaneously reduce anxiety and enhance language-speaking skills among international university students, who often feel anxious when speaking a foreign language. This study addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of a humanoid robot powered by the OpenChat-3.5 LLM as a tandem partner for German language learning. Using a between-subjects design with 22 multilingual participants, two interaction conditions were tested: immersive (German-only) and bilingual (German-English). Our findings indicate that participants in the immersive mode reported experiencing significantly reduced perceived judgment by the robot compared to the bilingual mode. Although female participants showed a trend of greater improvement in learning gain, no significant gender differences were found. Open-ended feedback highlighted the need for enhanced contextual responses, slower speech rate, faster response times, and error corrections to enhance language speaking support. This study aims to advance social robots for learning by demonstrating the usage of generative AI in creating non-judgmental language practice scenarios.",,,
"The Impact of Immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality on Medical Field: A Review of Cognitive Load, Learning Efficiency, and Practical Applications",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011531/,"This paper describes how AR is transformed into healthcare, particularly when viewed from the perspective of medical imaging, surgical precision, and education, and examines how this integration is done, demonstrating its potential for enhancing clinical practice, engagement of patients, and customized interventions. Thus, AR combined with VR, AI, and robotics will open a new door for healthcare delivery, educational, and training revolutions. The main drawbacks include regulatory challenges, high costs, and clinical validation. This needs further research on this area to move forward. Cognitive load measuring using AR is another important aspect of user experience which removes the traditional method on performance tests or subjective ratings. The use of non-invasive sensors has been combined with physiological measures in recent times. An example is eye-tracking, which will provide us with real-time data of cognitive load; but it is still uneven, and we require a multi-method approach to overcome this.

Student Teaching and Learning System for Academic Institutions,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9824437/,"In today's global online environment, automation is essential for establishing a competitive advantage. Conversational Artificial Intelligence Systems are an example of an automation technology that has been embraced by some of world's most famous companies. In the field, higher education, these handy gadgets come in handy for administrators.Students' responses and performances are highly important and desired areas to improve the teaching-learning environment in the education organism. Evaluate the feedback to aid in the identification of flaws and actions. Institutes and universities in the field of education collect both quantitative and qualitative responses in order to improve the teaching-learning environment. However, most educational institutions and universities lack a sufficient student feedback evaluation system for determining students' feelings. The grading technique is currently being utilized to collect input. However, the grading process does not reveal the students' genuine feelings about the educational system, whereas written feedback allows students to describe specific areas and situations. Sentiment analysis is a type of qualitative feedback analysis that is based on records. The Nave Bayes (NB) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest were employed in the majority of recent machine learning-based Sentiment Analysis prototypes. When it comes to measuring performance, most people utilize the kids' average grades, however this is not an accurate way. Because students can benefit from the experience indefinitely.This proposal offered a method for analyzing the sentiment of students' responses by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence algorithms (AI). The goal is to combine machine learning algorithms and natural language processing approaches to achieve high accuracy. In this proposal, I suggested a collective model that connects machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy and performance. At the end of the presentation, AI planned to collect student responses in real time. The proposed method analyzes student comments from course reviews to determine mood, emotions, and satisfaction vs. displeasure. The approach categorizes sentimentalities into two categories: positive and negative, and senders' feelings into eight categories (8 emotion groups). The Fuzzy logic technique will be used to assess student performance. We intend to make our program available for broad use in the education industry so that organizations can improve the teaching-learning environment's quality.",,,

An AI-Human Collaboration Chatbot with Digital Representation of Users for Knowledge Sharing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11034859/,"With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, conversational agents are becoming a norm in everyday lives. These agents can become more intelligent if they can collaborate with humans or other agents in analysing the conversation with the user. This work presents the use of AI to connect different sets of users and help them solve their life problems. Currently, sharing the wisdom of the old generation is happening within the close family or the student circle alone. To receive knowledge from a wider community at their fingertips, we designed a chatbot called wisdomBOT which can connect the younger generation users with the older generation users to receive their wisdom through the sharing of life experiences and stories and to learn from them. It also helps to address the loneliness of the older generation and connect them through a new way to make younger friends.",,,
Leveraging Machine Learning to Personalize Learning and Reduce Close Book Examination Stress,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031490/,"Growing academic burden and dependence on traditional close book assessments have frequently compromised learning and mental well-being. We can also simply explore machine learning field, in situations with clear set of skills, reading and comprehension, etc., and give individual insights that tell educators what area they need to focus on. And, similarly, how machine learning could generate a tailored learning experience and remove the stress of conventional assessments altogether. This information can be used by adaptive learning systems, so that they can customize educational content for each student based on their individual needs. This is balanced against students being able to ingest information at their most suitable speed and also to focus on areas that they're struggling to master or hone and finesse skills that they already do possess in their toolkit. However, that kind of bespoke support does not focus solely on knowledge retention - it builds confidence that, in turn, will alleviate the anxiety that comes with high -stakes testing. Chat GPT, smart quizzes and ML based platforms, have the most potential that could be used for continuous formative assessment, and can provide real-time feedbacks and track progress overtime. Whereas you were always encouraged to cram knowledge to the best of your ability, which was once a must with close book examination formats, these tools foster active learning. Students will identify where their learning is lacking and be able to correct it over days, weeks and months and in doing so make the entire joy of learning meaningful, child friendly, stress free.” Another great exploding advantage of machine learning in the education sector is predicting academic performance and emotional states. Using techniques such as sentiment analysis or behavioral tracking through learning management systems, educational institutions can identify students who are struggling or demonstrating signs of stress around examinations. This allows you to put in early interventions - for example, a tailored-approach mental health support or workload adaptation - and intervene before stress can domino. Furthermore, ML-driven intelligent tutoring machines can imitate the coaching style of a human by offering personalized hints, explanations, or analysis of study schedules.",,,
Use of recorded video to enhance students’ learning in measurement units,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10248573/,"Measurement is an important skill that need to master by all the undergraduate students that enroll into construction-related degree programmes.

Preference Cognitive Diagnosis for Student Performance Prediction,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9284428/,"Knowledge states modeling is a fundamental issue in online education. One of its tasks is to discover the potential knowledge capacity of students for predicting their performance (i.e., scores on exercises). Current studies either depend on cognitive diagnosis approaches or apply collaborative filtering. However, the prediction accuracy of traditional cognitive diagnosis is insufficient, and collaborative filtering has difficulty ensuring the interpretability of prediction. Actually, students usually read some auxiliary text learning materials that they are interested in, namely, preferred learning material, to consolidate what they have learned. Preference cognitive diagnosis means that the preferred learning materials can reflect the students’ knowledge states (i.e., proficiency for knowledge concepts) to some extent, which is beneficial for predicting students’ performance. Therefore, we propose a preference cognitive diagnosis method (<italic xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">PreferenceCD</i>) to model students’ knowledge states.

This method mines important information from students’ reading content that can reflect their preference for learning materials to acquire those preferred learning materials directly. Moreover, it discovers preferred learning materials indirectly by analyzing the similarity of students’ learning behaviors during the reading process. Subsequently, we calculate students’ preference degree for knowledge concepts based on the acquired preferred learning materials and diagnose their proficiency for knowledge concepts by applying a cognitive diagnosis model. After that, we combine the above two aspects to model students’ knowledge states and further predict their scores on exercises.

StepGrade: Grading Programming Assignments with Context-Aware LLMs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147374/,"Grading programming assignments is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands careful evaluation across multiple dimensions of the code. To overcome these challenges, automated grading systems are leveraged to enhance efficiency and reduce the workload on educators. Traditional automated grading systems often focus solely on correctness, failing to provide interpretable evaluations or actionable feedback for students. This study introduces StepGrade, which explores the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs) as an innovative solution to address these challenges. Unlike regular prompting, which offers limited and surface-level outputs, CoT prompting allows the model to reason step-by-step through the interconnected grading criteria, i.e., functionality, code quality, and algorithmic efficiency, ensuring a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation. This interconnectedness necessitates the use of CoT to systematically address each criterion while considering their mutual influence. To empirically validate the efficiency of StepGrade, we conducted a case study involving 30 Python programming assignments across three difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, and advanced). The approach is validated against expert human evaluations to assess its consistency, accuracy, and fairness. Results demonstrate that CoT prompting significantly outperforms regular prompting in both grading quality and interpretability. By reducing the time and effort required for manual grading, this research demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 with CoT prompting to revolutionize programming education through scalable and pedagogically effective automated grading systems.",,,

The data is then sent to the student side to drive the pan-tilt in real-time to track and rotate to the corresponding field of view. The real-time status value is returned to the teacher side computer to achieve remote pan-tilt human-computer interaction.

Smart E-Learning Framework for Personalized Adaptive Learning and Sequential Path Recommendations Using Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10220065/,"Learning activities are considerably supported and improved by the rapid advancement of e-learning systems. This gives students a tremendous chance to participate in learning activities worldwide. The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform has emerged as one of the most significant platforms for e-learning as a result of the rapid growth of network information technologies. Due to the increased number of online courses available, it is harder for individual learners to choose the appropriate courses, activities, and learning paths for the actual necessities they want, which reduces their learning performances. Moreover, a sequential Recommender System (RS) can identify the learner’s future interest and suggest the subsequent item or learning content given a sequence of past interactions. This is in contrast to interactive recommendation methods that can create recommendations based on the learner’s feedback via constant interactions. To address these challenges, the goal of this paper is to propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based smart e-learning framework with Markov Decision Process (MDP) that has the potential to enhance the learning experience for each student by providing them with a personalized and effective learning path. Applying the MDP and RL-based techniques such as Q-learning for Sequential Path Recommendation (SPR) and learning development is more achievable. This is because the MDP allows for adjusting the recommendations method to find new activities and learning paths based on the learners’ feedback on recommendations results. Experimental findings reveal that the suggested model obtains significant improvements and provides viable performance under different parameters optimization. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed method outperforms a long session (long-term rewards such that they maximize learning progress while minimizing frustration and disengagement). This demonstrates the model’s improvements in simulating the learner’s sequential behavior, learning activities, various learning materials, and learning paths simultaneously. These promising initial results provide a possible solution to assess this challenge further in future work.",,,

We distill semantic knowledge from a large-sized teacher (transformer-based), that has been trained on huge amount of public and private data, into our Edge candidate (student) model (Bi-LSTM based) and further compress the student model using a lossy quantization method. We show that unlike monolingual models, in a multilingual scenario, post-compression finetuning on downstream tasks is not enough to recover the performance loss caused by compression. We design a fine-tuning pipeline to recover the lost performance using a compounded loss function consisting of NLU, distillation and compression losses. We show that pre-biasing the encoder with semantics learned on a language modeling task can further improve the performance when used in conjunction with DQT pipeline. Our best performing multilingual model achieves a size reduction of 85% and 99.2% when compared to uncompressed student and teacher models respectively.

We conduct a user study on ten 8th-grade students to empirically evaluate the performance of PhysicsAssistant with a human expert. The Expert rates the assistants’ responses to student queries on a 0-4 scale based on Bloom’s taxonomy to provide educational support. We have compared the performance of PhysicsAssistant (YOLOv8+GPT-3.5-turbo) with GPT-4 and found that the human expert rating of both systems for factual understanding is same.

Align-KD: Distilling Cross-Modal Alignment Knowledge for Mobile Vision-Language Large Model Enhancement,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11092300/,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) bring powerful understanding and reasoning capabilities to multimodal tasks. Meanwhile, the great need for capable aritificial intelligence on mobile devices also arises, such as the AI assistant software. Some efforts try to migrate VLMs to edge devices to expand their application scope. Simplifying the model structure is a common method, but as the model shrinks, the trade-off between performance and size becomes more and more difficult. Knowledge distillation (KD) can help models improve comprehensive capabilities without increasing size or data volume. However, most of the existing large model distillation techniques only consider applications on single-modal LLMs, or only use teachers to create new data environments for students. None of these methods takes into account the distillation of the most important cross-modal alignment knowledge in VLMs. We propose a method called Align-KD to guide the student model to learn the cross-modal matching that occurs at the shallow layer. The teacher also helps student learn the projection of vision token into text embedding space based on the focus of text.

Empathy in education is very important, because service experiences in student academic services that are emotional and generate student affective responses have an influence on student motivation and academic achievement. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) allow computers to gain the ability to express empathy by analyzing and reacting to user emotional expressions via chatbot conversational agents. Chatbots with human-like cues such as their language style can also affect user emotions. In order for chatbots to have human-like cues, it is necessary to apply the concepts in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to chatbots.

Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning via Residual Momentum,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287941/,"Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning representations from unlabeled data. Momentum-based contrastive frameworks such as MoCo-v3 have shown remarkable success among the many SSL methods proposed in recent years. However, a significant gap in encoder representation exists between the online encoder (student) and the momentum encoder (teacher) in these frameworks, limiting the performance on downstream tasks. We identify this gap as a bottleneck often overlooked in existing frameworks and propose “residual momentum” that explicitly reduces the gap during training to encourage the student to learn representations closer to the teacher’s. We also reveal that a similar technique, knowledge distillation (KD), to reduce the distribution gap with cross-entropy-based loss in supervised learning is useless in the SSL context and demonstrate that the intra-representation gap measured by cosine similarity is crucial for EMA-based SSLs. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets and architectures demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning baselines. Specifically, our method outperforms MoCo-v3 0.7% top-1 in ImageNet, 2.82% on CIFAR-100, 1.8% AP, and 3.0% AP75 on VOC detection pre-trained on the COCO dataset; it also improves DenseCL with 0.5% AP (800ep) and 0.6% AP75 (1600ep).

Overwhelmed by complicated learning resources, a problem named “information overload” was widely discussed in online education. AI-based Recommender System, which is recognized as the powerful solution to improve resource acquisition via customized supply, has been regarded as an assistant in online learning by giving personalized learning strategies. In this paper, a Personalized Learning Path Recommender System with LINE Bot is proposed to meet personal preferences on path of learning. A LSTM model is built to consider video-watching preference features, clusters of students and learning paths to recommend personal learning path suitable for each student. Related recommendation contents and prediction results will be received by users through in-time LINE massages, achieving the goal of making in-time and active recommendations. From the evaluation part, F1-score of the proposed Learning Path Prediction Model is 0.8, indicating this model has a certain degree of accuracy. On the other hand, the proposed system is used in two courses of NTHU Cloud to give personalized learning path guidance. The experimental results demonstrate that learning path recommendations will help students have stronger learning willingness to keep learning, and help plan proper study steps to fulfill their own learning needs. On the other hand, this system provides another way except examinations to make judgements about one's learning status, and most learners agree that this kind of recommendations is helpful to review unfamiliar concepts and catch up with others.",,,

End-to-End Automation of Feedback on Student Assembly Programs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678837/,"We developed a set of tools designed to provide rapid feedback to students as they learn to write programs in assembly language (LC-3, a RISC-like educational instruction set architecture). At the heart of the system is an extended version of KLEE, KLC3, that enables us to both identify issues and perform equivalence checking between student code and a gold (correct) version of each assignment. Feedback begins when students edit their code using a VSCode extension that leverages static analysis to perform a variety of correctness and style checks, encouraging students to improve their code quality. Each time a student commits code to their Git repository, our system triggers. Using KLC3 (KLEE), the student code is executed along with the gold version, and issues and behavioral differences are delivered back to the student through their Git repository as a human-readable report, test cases, and scripts. A queueing system allows students to monitor progress, but responses are generally available within minutes. We also extended the LC-3 simulation tools to support reverse debugging, making the process of finding complex bugs much more tractable for students, and used Emscripten to develop a browser-based interface for use in testing and debugging. Finally, our system maintains an individual regression test suite for each student and requires a submission to pass all previous tests before re-evaluation in KLC3, thus avoiding encouraging programming-by-guesswork. We deployed the system to provide feedback for the assembly programming assignments in a class of over 100 students in Fall 2020. Students wrote a median of around 700 lines of assembly for these assignments, making heavy use of our tools to understand and eliminate their bugs. Anonymous student feedback on the tools was uniformly positive. Since that semester, we have continued to refine and expand our tools’ analysis capabilities and performance, and plan to deploy the system again in the near future (the class is offered every Fall).",,,
A Framework for AI-Powered Decision Making in Developing Adaptive e-Learning Systems to Impact Learners' Emotional Responses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10493103/,"This paper proposes and implements an AI-based decision framework for e-learning systems that can assess learners' emotions and adjust the learning activity in order to improve learning performance. An evolutionary genetic algorithm is proposed to identify suitable micro-brake activities to alter learners' emotions in the event learners feel emotions that are not optimal for learning, such as anxiety or sadness, so they can concentrate on learning more effectively. To test the proposed framework, a case study was conducted with English as second language learners over one semester. Fourteen participants were recruited from a gifted school and were randomly allocated to two groups, each consisting of seven participants. The first group was provided access to the system and its break activities, whereas the second group had no access to this system. The results showed that students with access to the system with break activities performed significantly better. This confirmed that micro-break activities, selected based on students' sentiments and inclinations, can have a positive effect on learning performance. The results have also confirmed that the proposed framework was successful in selecting and offering students effective activities that could improve student's mood. The results of this study hold significant practical implications for the design of adaptive e-learning systems and learning management platforms.

Speed Up! Cost-Effective Large Language Model for ADAS Via Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10588799/,"This paper presents a cost-effective approach to utilizing large language models (LLMs) as part of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) through a knowledge-distilled model for driving assessment. LLMs have recently been employed across various domains. However, due to their size, they require sufficient computing infrastructure for deployment and ample time for generation. These characteristics make LLMs challenging to integrate into applications requiring real-time feedback, including ADAS. An existing study employed a vector database containing responses generated from an LLM to act as a surrogate model. However, this approach is limited when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, which LLMs excel at. We propose a novel approach that utilizes a distilled model obtained from an established knowledge distillation technique to perform as a surrogate model for a target LLM, offering high resilience in handling OOD situations with substantially faster inference time. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we also introduce a new dataset for driving scenarios and situations (DriveSSD), containing 124,248 records. Additionally, we augment randomly selected 12,425 records, 10% of our DriveSSD, with text embeddings generated from an embedding model.

Autograder Impact on Software Design Outcomes,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343266/,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an analysis of autograder usage on software engineering design outcomes. Autograders have found increasing use in software engineering and computer science courses due to a variety of reasons. They are often introduced to support large class sizes, increase the reproducibility of grades, and provide formative feedback to students. Many of the classes that apply autograders are introductory in nature, such as CS1 and CS2 courses, or an introduction to algorithms course. These courses typically focus on assessing student programming ability on specific aspects of a programming language (e.g., Java inheritance) or algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching). One common drawback to automated assessment with programming is the need to impose additional structure on assignments. For example, students asked to implement a game might be given a detailed list of functions to implement, skipping analysis and design to determine what functions and algorithms are relevant. In this work, we discuss the experience of introducing an autograder into a second-year course that teaches software engineering topics such as personal software process, object-oriented design, and UML. Although we have the traditional motivations to use an autograder, it is challenging in a software engineering course since the additional structure required by an autograder is potentially detrimental to the engineering design outcomes. To address this, we developed an autograder in such a way as to minimize the design choices that it imposed on the students. The partial structure that is imposed together with the formative feedback produced by the autograder helps to scaffold student learning as they transition to more complex programs. The autograder was used during a spring 2023 offering of our software engineering course. We analyzed the data gathered in this course to evaluate the course change by asking: how does introducing an autograder impact course design outcomes? And, how does introducing an autograder impact personal process data that is collected? Answering these questions helps to inform the software engineering community about the suitability of introducing automated assessment tools into advanced computing and software engineering courses.",,,

Lifelong Dual Generative Adversarial Nets Learning in Tandem,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141633/,"Continually capturing novel concepts without forgetting is one of the most critical functions sought for in artificial intelligence systems. However, even the most advanced deep learning networks are prone to quickly forgetting previously learned knowledge after training with new data. The proposed lifelong dual generative adversarial networks (LD-GANs) consist of two generative adversarial networks (GANs), namely, a Teacher and an Assistant teaching each other in tandem while successively learning a series of tasks. A single discriminator is used to decide the realism of generated images by the dual GANs. A new training algorithm, called the lifelong self knowledge distillation (LSKD) is proposed for training the LD-GAN while learning each new task during lifelong learning (LLL). LSKD enables the transfer of knowledge from one more knowledgeable player to the other jointly with learning the information from a newly given dataset, within an adversarial playing game setting. In contrast to other LLL models, LD-GANs are memory efficient and does not require freezing any parameters after learning each given task.

In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based on a real-world campus dataset of college students (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N =156$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) that aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom. Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of long short-term memory (LSTM). (2) Second, machine learning-based classification algorithms are developed to predict academic performance. (3) Finally, visualized feedback enabling students (especially at-risk students) to potentially optimize their interactions with the university and achieve a study-life balance is designed.

These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level.

Semi-Supervised Learning With Fact-Forcing for Medical Image Segmentation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246276/,"Precise and robust image segmentation is one of the most important steps in supervised deep learning-applied studies. Especially in the medical field, image segmentation requires an enormous time and professionals with clinical knowledge. Although there are constant attempts for automatic and semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm development, acquiring not only clinically accurate but also precise pixel-level annotations for medical images remains insufficient. This article presents a semi-supervised learning method with a novel fact-forcing process, referred to as FFSS, to reduce the labeling cost while improving the prediction accuracy for medical image segmentation. FFSS includes two components: a pre-trained teacher and a student that would be trained, iteratively. In each iteration, the teacher first generates a pseudo-label for each image in an unlabeled set, the student is then trained on the pseudo-labeled set and sends feedback to update the teacher. A fact-forcing process is designed to improve the quality of the student model using a labeled set. We have comprehensively evaluated our method on both three-dimensional binary segmentation and two-dimensional multi-class segmentation. The evaluation results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of FFSS compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Due to the fact-forcing process, the proposed method consistently outperforms the other ones under various labeled data ratios for all benchmark datasets, including left atrium MRI, pancreas CT, ACDC MRI, and OCT. By refining the quality of student feedback with complementary supervised training, the proposed FFSS shows robustness under labeled data scarcity for diverse types of medical images.",,,

An approach to dealing with incremental concept drift in personalized learning systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10063636/,"In recent years, personalized learning systems have garnered significant academic research attention in the field of education. In a personalized learning system, learners receive a customized learning style that is tailored to their unique needs, goals, and abilities. Thus, students can achieve their objectives faster than with the traditional method of learning. Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technologies enable tracking and influencing each student’s learning process. Machine learning algorithms facilitate the determination of students’ learning styles, abilities, and progress throughout the learning process. One of the major challenges to effective personalization is the resistance of machine learning models to adapt to non-stationary data streams. Machine learning models for personalized learning systems are susceptible to the concept drift phenomenon, in which the models’ performance deteriorates over time due to changes in data distribution. For successful personalization, it is critical for the underlying predictive and classification models to adapt to data distribution changes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address concept drifts in personalized learning systems, and evaluate the approach on the OULAD dataset infused with concept drift. The proposed method comprises training utilizing sequential features extracted automatically.",,,

A chatbot is an application in natural language conversations to simulate intelligent interactions. Intelligent chatbots are needed to understand user needs and answer questions relevantly. We propose a chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation approach involving a retriever with cosine similarity search using OpenAI Ada embeddings to obtain relevant documents. The LLM OpenAI GPT-3.5- Turbo then generates the final answer. The chatbot mechanism begins with the retrieval module systematically identifying documents stored in the vector database that contain relevant information related to the user's query. The selected documents and query are provided to the LLM as part of the prompt to generate responses based on the knowledge provided in the relevant documents. The retrieval method is evaluated based on two criteria: the search method and the embedding model. The comparison method uses similarity search with Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search and the proposed embedding method against other models such as Google Embedding-001 and MPNet-Multilingual. The retrieval process is assessed using an evaluation dataset that incorporates Recall and Precision metrics, while answer generation is measured with BLEU and ROUGE Score. The observed disparity result between similarity search and MMR is not notably significant. Nonetheless, our chatbot holds an advantage in referencing past conversations due to its ability to store conversation history. Furthermore, potential enhancements are identified by augmenting the knowledge provided to the LLM in forthcoming iterations.",,,

Prompt Engineering or Fine-Tuning: An Empirical Assessment of LLMs for Code,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11025620/,"The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly expanded the potential for automated code-related tasks. Two primary methodologies are used in this domain: prompt engineering and fine-tuning. Prompt engineering involves applying different strategies to query LLMs, like Chat-GPT, while fine-tuning further adapts pre-trained models, such as CodeBERT, by training them on task-specific data. Despite the growth in the area, there remains a lack of comprehensive comparative analysis between the approaches for code models. In this paper, we evaluate GPT-4 using three prompt engineering strategies-basic prompting, in-context learning, and taskspecific prompting-and compare it against 17 fine-tuned models across three code-related tasks: code summarization, generation, and translation. Our results indicate that GPT-4 with prompt engineering does not consistently outperform fine-tuned models. For instance, in code generation, GPT-4 is outperformed by finetuned models by 28.3% points on the MBPP dataset. It also shows mixed results for code translation tasks. Additionally, a user study was conducted involving 27 graduate students and 10 industry practitioners. The study revealed that GPT-4 with conversational prompts, incorporating human feedback during interaction, significantly improved performance compared to automated prompting. Participants often provided explicit instructions or added context during these interactions. These findings suggest that GPT-4 with conversational prompting holds significant promise for automated code-related tasks, whereas fully automated prompt engineering without human involvement still requires further investigation.",,,
Keynote Speech Title: Intelligent Agent with Reasoning under Uncertainty,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9773569/,"Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. An intelligent agent is a program that can make decisions or perform a service based on its environment, user input and experiences. These programs can be used to autonomously gather information on a regular, programmed schedule or when prompted by the user in real time. Agents in real environments are inevitably forced to make decisions based on incomplete information. Even when an agent senses the world to find out more information, it rarely finds out the exact state of the world. For example, a doctor does not know exactly what is going on inside a patient, a teacher does not know exactly what a student understands, and a robot does not know what is in a room it left a few minutes ago. When an intelligent agent must act, it has to use whatever information it has. This lecture consider reasoning with uncertainty that arises whenever an agent is not omniscient.",,,

Workforce Development for the New Blue Economy: Progress and Evolution of a Master's Program in Operational Oceanography at Rutgers University,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10337348/,"Rutgers University's accelerated master's degree program in Operational Oceanography (MOO) was established in 2019 to fulfill the workforce gap of the New Blue Economy (NBE), which includes satisfying renewable energy demands as the global population approaches 9 billion by 2050. The MOO program provides students experiential learning opportunities throughout the entire 12-month curriculum, often intersecting with the various technology and data teams that operate a state-of-art ocean observing network and comprise RU COOL (Rutgers University's Center for Ocean Observing Leadership), an internationally oceanographic center of excellence developing new technologies, research, outreach, and educational paradigms for working in the ocean. Students collaborate as a cohort on hands-on activities and assignments involving operational oceanographic equipment, specifically the large fleet of Slocum gliders and expansive network of High-Frequency Radar, both of which are key data pillars for RU COOL. Students work independently on data analysis, learning to analyze, synthesize, and visualize large datasets of real-time oceanographic data and numerical ocean model output on Rutgers University's High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, all using the versatile and transferable Python programming language. These were the tenets with which the program was initialized. In the past 4 years, the MOO program has evolved considerably. The first 2 years saw the students mostly remote due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, with limited experiential learning opportunities either in the lab or in the field. The program was pivoted to a strong focus on data processing during this time, such that the graduates would still be both competitive and capable upon degree completion. As those restrictions lifted in the third year and the program returned to the original intent, focus was redistributed across both tenets. Internalizing both student feedback and performance after each course and year, as well as industry feedback on desired skills, the program curriculum shifted significantly for the fourth year. Students were tasked to collaboratively run two quarterly glider deployments. This included coordination with our glider staff team for preparation, and real-time marine weather-based decision making for the operation and piloting, as well as extensive subsequent data analysis. This unique learning opportunity came with significant student responsibility, but the cohort collaboration and tapered support from the glider staff team ultimately allowed for great student successes. The endeavor realized the student-led glider transect offshore of New Jersey, originally conceptualized at the creation of the program. This element of the ocean observatory of RU COOL now enables applied, operational experience for subsequent cohorts in the MOO program. The program's goal has been to capitalize on the unique ocean observing lab resources and capabilities of RU COOL and Rutgers to meet the NBE workforce needs with the accelerated, experiential learning of a new generation of operational oceanography graduate students. Through the continual evolution of the program towards this goal, all MOO graduates have received employment in an oceanography-related career. The program curriculum continues to refine and adapt with each cohort, both to enhance the applied, experiential learning opportunities and to ensure skill proficiency that continually aligns with industry and government workforce needs. And while these global needs exceed the capacity of the MOO program to solely meet, our program may serve as a model for other universities to begin developing their own NBE pipelines.",,,
Satisfaction of Students Toward Media and Technology Innovation Amidst COVID&#x2010;19,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10953818/,"Summary <p>This study looks at how English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instructors at Al Asyariah Mandar University feel about their participation in the creation of digital resources. The author bases this opinion on the assumption that creating high‐quality educational resources for use online is a top priority. In keeping with the university's new philosophy of customized education, concerns were identified through the student experience and level of satisfaction in developing online course materials. As the internet and digital technologies increase, more opportunities will emerge for teachers to use technology to aid in the learning and teaching of a second or foreign language. Educational institutions need to carefully assess the implications of implementing any form of new technology in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to better understand how EFL students feel about using internet resources in the classroom. This chapter uses a mixed methods strategy to investigate whether the online EFL teaching mode meets the needs of their students or not. The majority of students prefer to use digital tools such as Zoom, Google Classroom, WhatsApp Groups, and Padlet for lectures; e‐books, blogs, Mangatoon, NovelToon, AnimeTv, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, movies and songs for course materials; and Quizziz, Wakelet, and Quizlet for online assessments. As the study authors point out, educators’ own expectations, motivations, and worldviews have a significant impact on how well they implement technology tools in the classroom. Teachers who favor a more conventional approach to language teaching tend to favor mixed methods. Almost all (97%) of the 109 respondents agreed that EFL teachers use technology in the classroom appropriately. WBL Almost all respondents (97%) felt that the quality of the resources delivered was reflected in the amount of time and effort expended in designing a learning center setting that supports the curriculum. 94% of people who took the survey felt the same way. It was said that 93.9% of the feedback students received was of sufficient quality, that 85.7% of the time students spent working together in groups or with friends was productive, and that 99.0% of respondents would recommend a learning situation that encourage synthesis and analysis for another. As a result, constructivists in the field of education are vying for power in the EFL class that utilizes technological tools. The findings of this study can inform the efforts of education authorities to improve media literacy of ESL students.</p>",,,
A Comprehensive Hybrid Model for Movie Recommendation: Integrating CNN and Traditional Algorithms,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10940613/,"In recent times, a significant portion of entertainment consumption comes from watching movies, prompting movie creation and researchers to seek expert systems that can accurately predict a movie's success probability before production. These days people are used to these things that they want all the recommendations, even though it is not that difficult to choose movies based on own preferences. Many users often rely on search engines for specific movie-related information, highlighting the importance of recommendation systems that analyze past search behaviors and interests. This study develops a movie recommendation system using publicly available Internet Movie Database (IMDB) data, employing a hybrid model approach that integrates Collaborative Filtering (KNN), Latent Factor Modeling (SVD), Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF), and Sentiment Analysis (CNN). It further presents an analysis of Collaborative and Content-Based recommender systems to assist in selecting suitable machine learning algorithms based on specific requirements. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 0.9239 with the CNN model, surpassing all benchmark models. These findings underscore the significant potential of predictive and prescriptive data analytics in information systems, providing valuable insights to support industry decision-making in the movie recommendation domain. Additionally, the system effectively handles edge cases, such as non-existent user IDs or movie titles, and ensures that recommendations exclude already rated movies to maintain relevance.",,,
DriveAdapter: Breaking the Coupling Barrier of Perception and Planning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10378531/,"End-to-end autonomous driving aims to build a fully differentiable system that takes raw sensor data as inputs and directly outputs the planned trajectory or control signals of the ego vehicle. State-of-the-art methods usually follow the ‘Teacher-Student’ paradigm. The Teacher model uses privileged information (ground-truth states of surrounding agents and map elements) to learn the driving strategy. The student model only has access to raw sensor data and conducts behavior cloning on the data collected by the teacher model. By eliminating the noise of the perception part during planning learning, state-of-the-art works could achieve better performance with significantly less data compared to those coupled ones.However, under the current Teacher-Student paradigm, the student model still needs to learn a planning head from scratch, which could be challenging due to the redundant and noisy nature of raw sensor inputs and the casual confusion issue of behavior cloning. In this work, we aim to explore the possibility of directly adopting the strong teacher model to conduct planning while letting the student model focus more on the perception part. We find that even equipped with a SOTA perception model, directly letting the student model learn the required inputs of the teacher model leads to poor driving performance, which comes from the large distribution gap between predicted privileged inputs and the ground-truth.To this end, we propose DriveAdapter, which employs adapters with the feature alignment objective function between the student (perception) and teacher (planning) modules. Additionally, since the pure learning-based teacher model itself is imperfect and occasionally breaks safety rules, we propose a method of action-guided feature learning with a mask for those imperfect teacher features to further inject the priors of hand-crafted rules into the learning process. DriveAdapter achieves SOTA performance on multiple closed-loop simulation-based benchmarks of CARLA.",,,
Online assessment of computer vision and robotics skills based on a digital twin,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9766459/,"This paper presents online simulation along with physical environments employing digital twins to develop robotic and computer vision applications, such as bin picking, by providing a virtual testing environment with real conditions for robotic systems and their surroundings. Particularly for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, this approach permits the integration of knowledge and practice remotely without having the need of requiring a physical robot, increasing equity and inclusivity in the assessment, by reducing the gap between students from different institutions due to the lack of resources to buy the required robotic devices and even enabling remote connection to the classrooms. The proposed task can be performed as long as the educational center counts with basic computer equipment and internet connection. This paper presents a bin picker application based on mono and stereo vision to make the classification of cylinders of different colors and sizes and their arrangement in a base by using image processing and depth estimation algorithms. The performance of the classification was measured in terms of the error in millimeters from the difference of the desired and the obtained position. The images used for classification were taken in real life considering the environment conditions, and a digital twin of the bin picker and objects was made. The image classification and the overall instructions that the robot performed were generated on MATLAB, where the data from the real environment captured by cameras was sent. From here, the instructions were sent to URsim, which serves as the robot controller, and the final virtual simulation with the models of the base and cylinders was performed on Kuka-Sim Pro. This approach can then be utilized to implement different assessments based on personal results from simulation activities. As this assessment requires specialized knowledge regarding robotics, computer vision and classification algorithms, this methodology is intended to be applied for university students, at the level that is adequate according to the educational programs of each university.",,,

Exploring a Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Adaptive Sign Language Translation in Deaf Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045598/,"Sign Language Translation (SLT) plays a crucial role in enhancing accessibility and literacy for the deaf community. However, SLT models face significant challenges, including limited annotated datasets, sign language variability, and generalization issues. This study proposes a Human-in-theLoop (HITL) SLT conceptual framework to enhance model adaptability through continuous teacher and student interactions. By integrating Federated Learning (FL), schools can train SLT models locally while preserving data privacy and accommodating regional sign language variations. The proposed framework enables teachers to refine model predictions via Active Learning, introduce new sign gestures using Few-shot Learning, and enhance adaptability through Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, FL facilitates decentralized model updates, reducing computational burdens while improving model inclusivity across multiple schools. The synergy between HITL and FL creates an adaptive system that evolves based on real-time feedback, making AI-driven SLT more effective in educational settings. Future directions include deploying the HITL-SLT model in real-world classrooms to evaluate its practical impact. Conducting small-scale studies with teachers and students will be essential for validating its effectiveness, refining model adaptability, and enhancing interactive learning experiences.",,,

Ethics as Transverse Subject in Engineering Education: A Review of Current Efforts,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938616/,"Engineering projects address society’s demands and are multidisciplinary by nature. The occurrence of catastrophic failures and the imperative for responsible innovation evidence the importance of linking education with holistic solutions to complex global issues. However, integrating scientific and technological information with social demands has been increasingly neglected. In universities, the division of knowledge into independent subjects reinforces the principle of fragmentation, challenging the perception of problems in professional training. This manuscript advocates a transverse and transdisciplinary approach to teaching ethics in engineering to explore the role of future professionals as agents of socioeconomic and environmental transformation. The concept of transverse education emerges where a given discipline traverses disciplinary boundaries and is integrated into academic training without increasing the course curriculum. A rapid literature review is conducted to assess the current state of engineering ethics education and identify whether Transverse Education in Engineering Ethics (TEEE) is being applied in engineering academic institutions. Documents indexed by Web of Science and Scopus databases were considered in the review, complemented by a supplementary search to reduce the risk of geographical bias. Records were selected based on publication date, focus on engineering ethics education, and application maturity of TEEE according to international guidelines and the Brazilian National Common Curricular Base. Low worldwide adherence to TEEE is revealed, with 5% of the selected engineering teaching/learning records addressing ethics in a transversal manner.

Predicting Students’ Performance With School and Family Tutoring Using Generative Adversarial Network-Based Deep Support Vector Machine,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9087871/,"It has been witnessed that supportive learning has played a crucial role in educational quality enhancement. School and family tutoring offer personalized help and provide positive feedback on students' learning. Predicting students' performance is of much interest which reflects their understanding on the subjects. Particularly it is desired students to manage well in fundamental knowledge in order to build a strong foundation for post-secondary studies and career. In this paper, improved conditional generative adversarial network based deep support vector machine (ICGAN-DSVM) algorithm has been proposed to predict students' performance under supportive learning via school and family tutoring. Owning to the nature of the students' academic dataset is generally low sample size. ICGAN-DSVM offers dual benefits for the nature of low sample size in students' academic dataset in which ICGAN increases the data volume whereas DSVM enhances the prediction accuracy with deep learning architecture. Results with 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed ICGAN-DSVM yields specificity, sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.968, 0.971 and 0.954 respectively. Results also suggest that incorporating both school and family tutoring into the prediction model could further improve the performance compared with only school tutoring and only family tutoring. To show the necessity of ICGAN and DSVM, comparison has been made between ICGAN and traditional conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Also, the proposed kernel design via heuristic based multiple kernel learning (MKL) is compared with typical kernels including linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The prediction of student's performance with and without GAN is presented which is followed by comparison with DSVM and with traditional SVM. The proposed ICGAN-DSVM outperforms related works by 8-29% in terms of performance indicators specificity, sensitivity and AUC.",,,

Investigating the Use of Generative ai in M&S Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10838805/,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly creating a place for themselves in society. There are numerous reports, both good and bad, of their use in business, academia, government and society. While some organizations are trying to limit, or eliminate, their use, it appears that it is inevitable they will become a common “tool”. In education, there is a fear that students will not acquire critical thinking in the future, but we argue that LLMs will become a tool to assist students with critical thinking, giving guidance, feedback, and assessment. This paper investigates how the current state of LLMs can be integrated into modeling and simulation (M&S) education.

Predicting Green Consumption Behaviors of Students Using Efficient Firefly Grey Wolf-Assisted K-Nearest Neighbor Classifiers,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8998214/,"Understanding the green consumption behaviors of college students is highly demanded to update the public and educational policies of universities. For this purpose, this research is devoted to advance an efficient model for identifying prominent features and predicting the green consumption behaviors of college students. The proposed prediction model is based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) with an effective swarm intelligence method, which is called OBLFA_GWO. The optimization core takes advantage of the firefly algorithm (FA) and opposition-based learning (OBL) to mitigate the immature convergence of the grey wolf algorithm (GWO). In the proposed prediction framework, OBLFA_GWO is utilized to identify influential features. Then, the enhanced KNN model is used to identify the importance and interrelationships of features in samples and construct an effective and stable predictive model for decision support. Five other well-known algorithms are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed OBLFA_GWO strategy using 13 benchmark test problems. Also, the non-parametric statistical Wilcoxon sign rank and Friedman tests are conducted to validate the significance of the proposed OBLFA_GWO against other peers. Experimental results indicate that the FA and OBL can significantly boost the core exploratory and exploitative trends of GWO in dealing with the optimization tasks. Also, the OBLFA_GWO-based KNN (OBLFA_GWO-KNN) model is compared with four classical classifiers, such as kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), backpropagation neural network method (BPNN), and random forest (RF) and five advanced feature selection methods in terms of four standard evaluation indexes. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed OBLFA_GWO-KNN can reach to 96.334 % on the real-life dataset collected from nine universities. Also, the proposed binary OBLFA_GWO algorithm has improved the classification performance of KNN compared to the other peers.

Early-Stage Detection of Cancer Cells Using Machine Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10452536/,"Cancer is an inflectional illness in which certain body cells become uncontrollably enormous and invade other bodily regions. Machine learning (ML) methodologies for classifying those with cancer into extremely dangerous or relatively low-risk categories have been investigated by multiple teams of investigators from both the biomedical and bioinformatics sectors. Given the number of deaths brought on by different cancers, it is thought to be a severe threat, but as a result of advances in medical research today, such a threat can be eliminated if discovered in its earliest stages without harming the patient. The main difficulty is identifying the patient's cancer type— whether it is benign or malignant—and making the appropriate diagnosis. By producing findings with high precision and accuracy, machine learning methods like K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) aid in the solution of this issue. Using KNN and SVM, this paper describes and illustrates how to identify cancer. An accurate comparison with previous studies is also made. We achieved reliability using K-Nearest Neighbors was 0.93586 for the F1 Score and 0.88008 for Jaccard Score, respectively.

Students Emotional Psychology on Online Learning During Pandemic Period,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10028825/,"The outbreak of the pandemic has had a great impact on all aspects of life, including educational systems. There has been a rapid shift to online learning, which has caused many students to feel anxious and overwhelmed. Students may feel anxious about online learning due to a lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers, as well as an inability to connect with their peers. They may also be worried about learning new technology and using unfamiliar tools, such as video conferencing applications. Furthermore, the lack of physical contact with classmates and teachers, as well as the unfamiliarity of the virtual environment, can be a source of anxiety for some students. In addition, students may be feeling isolated and lonely due to the physical distancing measures. Since students are not able to meet up with their peers and socialize like they used to, this can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay has warned that the unprecedented scale and speed of the current educational disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could threaten the right to education (UNESCO Press Release, 3 March 2020).

Palaute: An Online Text Mining Tool for Analyzing Written Student Course Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551880/,"Collecting student feedback is commonplace in universities. These surveys usually include both open-ended questions and Likert-type scale questions but the answers to open questions tend not to be analysed further than simply reading them. Recent research has shown that text mining and machine learning methods can be utilized to extract useful topics from masses of open student feedback. However, to our knowledge, not many off-the-shelf applications exist for processing open-ended student feedback automatically. Additionally, the use of text mining tools may not be available to all educators, as they require in-depth knowledge of text-mining, data analysis, or programming tools. To address this gap the current study presents a tool (Palaute) for analyzing written student feedback using topic modeling and emotion analysis. The utility of this tool is demonstrated with two real-life use cases: First, we analyze student feedback data collected from courses in a software engineering degree programme, and then feedback from all courses organized in a university. In our experiments, the analysis of open-ended feedback revealed that on certain software engineering course modules the workload is perceived as heavy, and on some programming courses the automatic code grader could be improved. The university-wide analysis produced indicators of good teaching quality, such as interesting courses, but also some concrete improvement points like the time given to complete course assignments. Therefore, the use of the tool resulted in actionable improvement points, which could not have been identified using only numeric feedback metrics.

Large Language Models (LLMs) in Programming Learning: The Current Research State and Agenda,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204697/,"Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in programming learning. However, existing studies mainly focus on technical implementations and lacks a systematic analysis of the application of LLMs in programming learning from an educational perspective. This study conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis based on 75 high-quality papers, using a six-dimensional framework (roles, technology, learners, environment, effectiveness, challenges) to examine the current state and agenda of LLM applications. The results indicate that the application of LLMs has evolved from model validation in 2022 to teaching applications in 2023, and is expected to be deeply integrated into the education system by 2024-2025, reflecting a shift from tools to teaching agents. In programming learning, LLMs primarily take on roles in resource generation, task solving, and feedback provision. In terms of technology usage, OpenAI's series of models dominate, with Python being the main programming language environment, and research subjects focusing on beginner programmers and university students. Empirical studies show that LLMs can effectively enhance learners' cognitive outcomes and non-cognitive performance, but they can also lead to over-reliance on tools, academic integrity risks, and ethical challenges.

Academic Temporal Pattern Mining for Enhanced Student Performance Prediction: A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011532/,"Predicting student academic performance effectively remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of learning behavior and the complex interplay of factors affecting student success. This paper introduces Academic Temporal Pattern Mining (ATPM), a novel approach that identifies critical time-based patterns in student academic behavior to enhance performance prediction accuracy. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static snapshots of student data, our approach analyzes sequential patterns in study habits, submission timings, and performance trends. Using a UCI Student Performance Dataset of 1,000 undergraduates, we demonstrate that temporal patterns such as assignment submission sequences and grade progression provide crucial predictive insights. Our hybrid model, combining Random Forest for feature stability and XGBoost for capturing non-linear relationships, achieves an accuracy of 87%, representing a 15% improvement over conventional regression-based methods. Moreover, we rigorously evaluate the statistical significance of these gains (p < 0.05) and show an 80% precision threshold for early warning up to three assessment cycles before final grades.

Pixel Distillation: Cost-Flexible Distillation Across Image Sizes and Heterogeneous Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579049/,"Previous knowledge distillation (KD) methods mostly focus on compressing network architectures, which is not thorough enough in deployment as some costs like transmission bandwidth and imaging equipment are related to the image size. Therefore, we propose Pixel Distillation that extends knowledge distillation into the input level while simultaneously breaking architecture constraints. Such a scheme can achieve flexible cost control for deployment, as it allows the system to adjust both network architecture and image quality according to the overall requirement of resources. Specifically, we first propose an input spatial representation distillation (ISRD) mechanism to transfer spatial knowledge from large images to student's input module, which can facilitate stable knowledge transfer between CNN and ViT. Then, a Teacher-Assistant-Student (TAS) framework is further established to disentangle pixel distillation into the model compression stage and input compression stage, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of pixel distillation and the difficulty of distilling intermediate knowledge. Finally, we adapt pixel distillation to object detection via an aligned feature for preservation (AFP) strategy for TAS, which aligns output dimensions of detectors at each stage by manipulating features and anchors of the assistant.

In this paper, we first describe a cellular HetNet model with uplink IoCT communications, then formulate a dynamic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) resource allocation problem for maximizing the long-term average energy efficiency under URLLC requirements including reliability, latency, and transmission rate. To solve the problem, we propose a decentralized MADRL-based resource allocation algorithm with a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (dec-POMDP) and a mixed-centralized-decentralized (MCD) framework to address the partial observability and the scalability issues, respectively. In addition, we design a reward function featuring the objective decomposition, baseline-guided scaling, and QoS violation penalty so that the agents are coordinated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the convergence, scalability, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms conventional resource allocation methods and different agent communication mechanisms in terms of maximizing energy efficiency.",,,
Adaptive Multidimensional E-Learning Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11050765/,"In recent years, adaptive learning systems have gained significant attention as a means to personalize education and enhance student outcomes. This study focuses on the development of a multidimensional adaptive e-learning system based on feedback mechanisms and data-driven decision-making. The proposed system aims to improve the learning experience by continuously analyzing student performance and adjusting educational content accordingly new data driven technologies [1].To achieve this, we employed a combination of data collection, processing, and analysis methods. The system gathers information from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data is obtained directly from students through surveys, tracking their demographic characteristics, learning preferences, and academic performance. These data points are used to build individualized learning profiles and identify deviations from expected progress [2]. The system also records user interactions, such as task completion rates, number of attempts, and error types, allowing for detailed behavioral analysis. Secondary data, including findings from authoritative research on adaptive learning, were used to refine the system’s decision-making algorithms.Machine learning techniques play a crucial role in data processing. We utilized the k-means clustering algorithm to categorize students [3] based on similar learning behaviors, such as average scores and time spent on tasks. This segmentation helps tailor instructional strategies to specific student groups [4], [5], thereby increasing engagement and effectiveness. The clustering approach was implemented using Python’s scikit-learn library, and the results were visualized to facilitate interpretation.The system was developed using modern web technologies: Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for database management, and React.js for an interactive user interface. Data analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.The practical significance of this research lies in its potential application in educational institutions to enhance teaching quality. By automating data analysis and generating personalized recommendations, the system reduces the burden on educators while improving student support. Additionally, the system can be expanded to analyze collaborative learning interactions and predict long-term academic performance.Future work will focus on integrating natural language processing (NLP) and neural network models to further refine personalization and feedback mechanisms.This study contributes to the advancement of adaptive learning technologies [6] by demonstrating a scalable and efficient approach to personalized education.",,,
Research on Intelligent Analysis Platform of Students Mental Health Based on Big Data Computation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10332736/,"In order to use big data analysis and artificial intelligence technology for students, educational institutions and parents need to better understand the mental health status of students to support them and provide intervention measures. Thus, we designed an intelligent analysis platform for student mental health to evaluate and predict it by collecting and analyzing multi-dimensional data such as personal information, learning behavior data, and social media activities. By using models and algorithms, the platform identified possible mental health problems of students such as anxiety, depression, and stress, and provided timely warnings and suggestions. At the same time, the platform provided customized mental health support and intervention programs based on students’ personalized needs and characteristics, including online psychological counseling, mental health education resources, and self-help tutoring tools to develop students’ mental health and improve academic achievement.",,,
Designing and Evaluating an Interactive Learning Technology to Foster Privacy Literacy,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321693/,"The “Privat-o-Mat” is a media ethics learning technology to promote reflection on privacy literacy. In this article, we discuss its ethical conception, design, and development and present a qualitative evaluation of the tool with a sample of secondary school students. Children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) today grow up in digitalized environments that threaten their privacy in various ways. Therefore, the development of an ethically founded privacy literacy, defined as the formation of a personal value system, constitutes a central developmental task. The Privat-o-Mat supports this CAYA age group to reflect on their behavior when facing privacy risks on the Internet. Based on the principles of human-centered design and ethics by design, it confronts users with 15 everyday scenarios to identify their personal type of data protection. We conducted an empirical evaluation of the Privat-o-Mat consisting of a survey followed by a qualitative content analysis according to P. Mayring and found that this learning technology enabled a sample of three different groups of students from the German state of Baden-Württemberg to reflect on their own attitudes toward privacy on the Internet. This effect was especially strong among respondents who considered their previous level of reflection on privacy to be low. Long-term behavioral change, however, would require the supplementation of the Privat-o-Mat with other learning technologies.",,,

Research on Grammar Improvement and Automatic Generation in English Writing Based on GPT-4,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11189491/,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large language models are increasingly used in the field of natural language processing, especially in the automated evaluation and improvement of English writing. This paper proposes a method for improving and automatically generating English writing grammar based on GPT-4 and generative adversarial networks (GAN). This method uses the powerful language generation ability of GPT-4 to automatically generate grammatically compliant and fluent text by fine-tuning student writing samples. In order to further optimize the quality of the generated text, we introduce GAN to conduct adversarial training on the generated results, thereby improving the grammatical accuracy, language fluency and overall generation quality of the text. The experiment uses writing data from undergraduate students, covering a variety of writing types and grammatical error types, including tense, subject-verb agreement, spelling errors, etc. By comparing with traditional grammar checker systems (such as Grammarly) and BERT models, the results show that the model based on the combination of GPT-4 and GAN is significantly superior to other methods in terms of grammatical accuracy ($92.5 \%$), fluency ($89.3 \%$) and generation quality ($91.2 \%$). This study not only demonstrates the application effect of combining GPT-4 and GAN in improving the automation of English writing, but also provides new ideas and technical support for intelligent writing tutoring systems. Future work will focus on further optimizing the model, improving its real-time feedback capabilities, and exploring cross-language application scenarios to expand the application prospects of this technology in different languages and writing tasks.",,,
Estimating Programming Exercise Difficulty using Performance Factors Analysis,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274142/,"This Work in Progress Paper studies student and exercise modelling based on pass/fail log data gathered from an introductory programming course. Contemporary education capitalizes on the communications technology and remote study. This can create distance between the teacher and students and the resulting lack of awareness of the difficulties students encounter can lead to low student satisfaction, dropout and poor grades. In many cases, various technological solutions are used to collect individual exercise submissions, but there are little resources for indexing or modelling the exercises in depth. Exercise specific feedback from students may not be easily obtainable either. In the present study, we attempt to create student-exercises models solely on pass/fail log data by using statistical techniques. We conclude that such data is insufficient for student modelling, but that it can be used to credibly estimate the difficulty of programming exercises.",,,
A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach to Decoding Student Participation in Online Classrooms,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973728/,"The COVID-19 has accelerated the e-learning usage, stressing a proper research of how students engage themselves in online classes. Previous works are mainly concerned with uni-modal treatment where data from only one modality such as facial expressions or eye-gaze is analyzed which provides a very narrow perspective of engagement. Towards this, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning framework fusing facial expression and eye gaze, textual chat and interaction transcripts, along with contextual data on learning. This framework uses deep learning models for analysing multimodal data in real time so that timely interventions and feedbacks can be given to each learner. It also improves interpretability by including attention mechanisms, which show the level of importance of the different modalities and features in producing engagement estimates. We also show through real-world experiments on a carefully selected benchmark set the effectiveness of the presented framework with respect to unimodal as well as the state of the art multimodal techniques. And not only that, it is capable of identifying engagement and also giving instructional suggestions to help educators modify their course and make learning more engaging. This research opens the way to the creation of adaptive e-learning systems that could enhance student-centered online learning environment.",,,
How to Enhance Causal Discrimination of Emotional Utterances: a Case on LLMs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039724/,"Existing methods, including large language models (LLMs), excel at capturing semantic correlations between utterances, but often struggle to accurately distinguish specific causal relationships. This limitation poses a significant challenge for reasoning-intensive tasks in affective computing, where precise identification of emotional triggers and their effects is crucial. Our preliminary work demonstrated the potential of introducing i.i.d. noise terms within Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task. However, this approach relied on end-to-end learning of high-dimensional latent representations, which hindered both scalability to LLMs and model interpretability. To address these issues, we conceptualize i.i.d. noise terms as token-level implicit causes—natural language expressions that reflect a speaker's underlying emotions, intentions, or situational context. Building on this insight, we introduce ICE (Implicit-Cause-Enhanced), an instruction-based framework that leverages implicit causes to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs. First, we design prompts that heuristically guide LLMs to generate implicit causes, which are then iteratively refined via an external evaluation mechanism. Second, by incorporating these implicit causes as intermediate reasoning steps, ICE improves the accuracy of emotion-cause pair prediction. Moreover, we distill the rationales produced by ICE into lightweight generative models, demonstrating that even small models can benefit from implicit-cause-driven reasoning. Extensive experiments in both instruction-based and distillation-based settings confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability of our approach.",,,
Conversational AI for Career Counseling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10575379/,"College students' life plans are heavily influenced by their career choices. Choosing the appropriate career is the most difficult decision in today’s society. Many kids today are unsure about their future. They do have certain talents, but they are unable to identify them or place them in the appropriate domain. Different individuals advisevarious career alternatives, but the student must ultimately choose their job. For giving a focus to this we have built an innovative method for student career advising that combines ML for job prediction and RASA(NLU) framework for a chatbot. The work is about a website that gives you the whole information that is needed for the knowledge of every student. Concurrently, a sophisticated RASA(NLU) chatbot is being developed to engage students in meaningful and tailored interactions. To provide viable job possibilities, the ML-based career prediction model examines numerous aspects such as talents, educational background, and hobbies. The chatbot, on the other hand, uses natural language understanding and generation techniques to deliver personalized advice, answer questions, and lead students toward proper educational and career options. This dual strategy guarantees a thorough and productive career counseling experience, allowing students to make educated decisions regarding their future. Comparison of three different Machine learning algorithms i.e. KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree was performed and KNN outperformed the other two. The accuracy obtained by this is 97% by use of the KNN model for job prediction. The integration of ML and NLU technologies contributes to a dynamic and personalized counseling environment, ultimately assisting students in achieving their professional aspirations.",,,
Unlocking Complexity: Harnessing Value Entropy for Advanced Multidimensional Utility Evaluation in Service Ecosystems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027322/,"The increasing prevalence of smart services in daily life drives the rapid emergence of service ecosystems across various domains such as E-commerce, cloud manufacturing, and crowdsourcing. Evaluating the utility of these ecosystems is challenging due to complex characteristics like diverse crowd intelligence, cascading service network effects, and the interplay of individual interests. To address these challenges, this study introduces an innovative utility evaluation model that integrates individual and systemic factors with multidimensional metrics, reconciling micro and macro perspectives. This model effectively addresses potential conflicts between individual and systemic benefits, supporting the continuous learning and evolution of agents within service ecosystems. It employs value entropy to precisely model and interpret complex nonlinear emergence phenomena. The model’s universal framework offers high customizability and broad applicability, facilitating specific adaptations across different service ecosystem scenarios. Additionally, a visual multi-agent system simulation tool has been developed to adjust agent attributes and cooperative topologies, allowing for the observation of system responses. Empirical validation confirms the model’s accuracy and provides a mechanistic explanation for emergence phenomena in human societies. The findings demonstrate the model’s high coordination and effectiveness in managing both linear and nonlinear characteristics, presenting a powerful and flexible tool for utility evaluation in service ecosystems..",,,
How to Automate Feedback on Diagrammatic Reasoning with a Relevant Degree of Freedom?,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016495/,"This paper considers Café 2.0, an Automated Feedback system designed to support students' diagrammatic reasoning in STEM disciplines. Café 2.0 relies on a predefined error library, metamodels, and rules to correct students' solutions and deliver formative feedback. Implementing such a system requires a balance between constraining the solution syntax to enable AF and leaving freedom to students to reflect on their solution. This paper aims to evaluate whether the level of freedom provided by our AF system sufficiently prepares students for exams. In the exam, they must reason and construct solutions starting with a blank page. This study is conducted in an introductory programming course (CS1), based on two semesters (in 2022 and 2023), where Café 2.0 supports online homework. Findings reveal a discrepancy between students' performance in online homework and their success on exams. While many students feel comfortable with fill-in-the-blank diagrams in their homework, they struggle with the open-ended nature of exam tasks. Our results show that, among the students who succeeded in their online homework in 2023, <tex xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">$20\%$</tex> were still unable to produce any diagram in the exam. Additionally, <tex xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">$70\%$</tex> of them could not correctly provide a text description of their solution. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced system that integrates predefined rules with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this framework, LLMs serve as translators. Students can freely create their diagrams and annotate them with their own textual descriptions using a drawing editor. The LLM then maps these representations into a more structured format that aligns with predefined rules. In this way, Café 2.0 can generate accurate feedback. This transformed representation retains the same informational content as the original, differing only in format. This feature will offer students greater flexibility in constructing their solutions while ensuring that feedback remains precise and consistent by limiting the role of LLMs to translation rather than feedback generation.",,,
Hyperbolic Hypergraph Transformer With Knowledge State Disentanglement for Knowledge Tracing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003808/,"Knowledge Tracing (KT) refers to inferring the students’ knowledge mastery and predicting their future performance. KT serves as the foundation for personalized learning and enhances the effectiveness of educational interventions, becoming a crucial technology in intelligent tutoring systems. Recent approaches have demonstrated notable success by harnessing the potent representational capacities of deep learning. However, complex neural networks lead to entangled knowledge state embeddings, where the embedding dimensions are coupled, limiting their expressiveness and interpretability. In addition, the limitations of existing methods in euclidean space result in distortions when capturing complex relationships among knowledge states. This distortion is reflected in the alteration of distances and geometric structures among knowledge states during the embedding process. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose a hyperbolic hypergraph transformer with knowledge state <bold xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">Disen</b>tanglement for <bold xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">K</b>nowledge <bold xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"">T</b>racing, named DisenKT. We construct the students’ response sequences into the hypergraph, projected into the hyperbolic space to alleviate the representation distortion problem of questions and knowledge states. The embeddings of hierarchical knowledge states are refined through message passing between questions and students based on the proposed hyperbolic hypergraph transformer. Moreover, we are the first to disentangle knowledge states via a contrastive clustering auxiliary task, which enhances the expressiveness and interpretability of knowledge state embeddings. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that DisenKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on student performance prediction and interpretability.",,,

Reinforced-LSTM Trajectory Prediction-Driven Dynamic Service Migration: A Case Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9762557/,"Predicting user behavior is the cornerstone of intelligent services and applications for providing and optimizing services over mobile networks. In modern edge computing scenarios, contents and services will be ordered close to end-users and will be highly sensitive to user mobility. Deep Learning models have had significant success in performing prediction tasks. However, providing reliable predictions for real-world networks in scale requires the Neural Architecture Search to be optimized on a user basis. In this work, we present an LSTM-based mobility predictor to improve the trajectory prediction accuracy. To speed up the model convergence rate, we employ a reinforcement learning technique to automate the selection procedure of the best neural network architecture. To further accelerate the reinforcement learning environmental search procedure, we transfer the architecture knowledge learned from a teacher LSTM to a student LSTM via a transfer learning framework. Furthermore, we showcase the possible improvements of edge-computing enabled networks, in the form of a predictive handover algorithm that applies the prediction information to reduce the handover-failure rate, as well as handover-triggered service migration in edge computing layer of the network.

Automating the Evaluation of Urdu Handwriting for Novice Writers With Localized Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500817/,"Handwriting is one of the basic skills crucial in communication and early childhood development. It plays a major role in the psychomotor and cognitive growth of children. Therefore, it is required to devise interesting and modern ways to teach this skill. A handwriting tutoring system designed to teach Urdu transcription engagingly and efficiently can help to solve this problem. Essential to these teaching systems is the quality evaluation module that analyzes and evaluates the quality of transcription based on legibility and writing process and provides feedback to the writer. This feedback can not only help the young students to improve and identify their mistakes but can also help to repair the handwriting skills of any individual wanting to improve their transcription abilities. The existing handwriting evaluation methods are either designed for Arabic writing style, or those designed for Urdu need more comprehensive feedback on the quality of handwriting. Therefore, it is the need of time to develop a technology-assisted educational system for teaching Urdu handwriting that evaluates and provides intelligent feedback to the learners. In this work, we have proposed an innovative model for evaluating different aspects of Urdu handwriting and providing qualitative and quantitative feedback. The system takes on real-time writing samples, and its transcription profiler module then individually evaluates six aspects of handwriting, including legibility, shape formation, the direction of writing, proportion with the baseline, count, and order of strokes. Based on the evaluation, the feedback generator module provides overall feedback and detects mistakes made while writing. A machine learning-based hybrid architecture is constructed that combines spatio-temporal and structural features to do a quality analysis of each aspect of the transcript. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, to develop a standard for evaluating the quality of Urdu handwriting or any cursive writing script, and second, to create an architecture that relies on machine learning-based models to provide detailed and intelligent feedback while learning handwriting. The system’s performance is verified by comparing it with the test data evaluated by real teachers. It achieved an average of 97% accuracy among all character classes in all handwriting aspects. The results show that the system is effective in identifying and correcting mistakes, thus helping individuals seeking to improve their handwriting skills.",,,
Exploration of Knowledge Graph Empowering Formative Assessment in Accounting Courses,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113635/,"As the digital intelligence reform of accounting advances and artificial intelligence technology is widely applied in the field of accounting, the cultivation of versatile accounting talents with expertise in intelligent technologies has become a consensus in both academic and industrial circles.

They fail to adequately consider the interconnectivity between various disciplines, and the depth and breadth of students' mastery of the professional knowledge system. To address this, teaching teams can create a knowledge map of the professional intelligent accounting knowledge system. Based on this knowledge map and combined with artificial intelligence technology, they can design a new formative assessment and feedback system.

AI-Enhanced Deep Learning Techniques for Evaluating Progress in English L2 Learners,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714836/,"The current trend of learning English as a second language (L2) especially at the international level has created a need to have assessment techniques to measure the improvement of the learners. This paper analyses the effectiveness of applying the Artificial Intelligence based Deep Learning known as Seq2Seq – Sequence to Sequence models with attention mechanism to assess and forecast the advancement of English L2 learners. To analyse the learner responses, and keep record on regarding changes/improvements in the linguistic features as time progresses, Seq2Seq models are used since they are effective in handling sequential data. The residual blocks enhances upon this process by allowing the model to focus on salient portions of the input sequence for eminently more accurate evaluations. This research employs contemporary computational approaches to analyse different areas of language development such as the lexis, syntax and the flow of the language. In essence, the model relies on a substantial amount of learner data to offer a good learner profile, and point out where learner might need extra help. The study uses a comprehensive dataset comprising of samples of learner-generated texts which have been tagged with proficiency level and markers of learning progress. Further, the incorporation of attention in the Seq2Seq model is compared to conventional assessment metrics where greater accuracy in assessing learner progress is achieved. In this way, it not only offers a quick method of creating an objective evaluation based on the need, but it also aids in realizing the idea of an individual learning experience by identifying the unique strengths and weaknesses of a particular student. The idea of incorporating AI deep learning algorithms supported by seq2seq models and attention techniques to assess English L2 learners is fresh in the current methodological context because it permits the attention to relevant language features such as syntax and grammar during the assessment conducted for the purpose of this study. The attention mechanism improves the accuracy by providing focus on certain linguistic aspects. This makes the feedback more suitable, specific from data collected and more efficient in tracking the learners’ progress than other assessments. The results highlight the applicability of deep learning methods in changing the way language learning and assessment processes occur, giving educators powerful tools in the learning process of learners of English as the second language.",,,

Using Factor Analysis to Increase Accuracy of Neural Networks for Predicting Student Test Scores,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893065/,"This work is a full research-to-practice paper that describes a predictive method to improve the prediction of student test scores. Predicting student test scores is difficult. However, doing so can improve education greatly by improving advising, scheduling, tutoring assignment and other educational processes. This research extends previous research by using a domain space reduction technique to improve accuracy. Factor Analysis is used to reduce the number of domain attributes for improving the accuracy of a Neural Network to predict student test scores. In this research datasets for Mathematics and Language of high school student test scores were used. Test scores were predicted using a Neural Network computing the Mean Absolute Error as a measurement of accuracy. The datasets have 30 domain attributes each. Factor Analysis was used to reduce the domain size from between 1 to 29, each time using it to train the Neural Network. Because the Mean Absolute Error may vary depending upon which records in the dataset are used for training versus testing, 50 trials of each dataset size were executed producing an Average Mean Absolute Error for each domain size. A statistical test was used to show statistical significance between the Neural Network without Factor Analysis and the Neural Network with varying domain sizes using Factor Analysis. Results were very promising and correspond to previous research that used Principal Component Analysis. Numerous domain sizes had significantly better Average Mean Absolute Errors than the accuracy of the Neural Network without Factor Analysis. This research shows that reducing the domain size using Factor Analysis can greatly improve the accuracy of Neural Networks when predicting student test scores. The best improvements occurred when domain sizes were very small ranging from 2 to 6. Domain reduction techniques, such as Factor Analysis, have been shown to improve predictive models for student test score prediction. Future research should consider other domain reduction techniques, like T-SNE, in combination with other predictive models, like Support Vector Machines.",,,
Leveraging the Learning Curve: Reusing Existing Architectural Patterns to Design and Implement MAS,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906495/,"Recent advancements in AI have led to the development of specialized systems related to multi-agent systems (MAS). However, the inherently collaborative nature of agents is often overlooked, and many of these specialized systems are used as components by other AI systems. From a software engineering perspective, this context can benefit from aligning the architectural characteristics of distributed systems with the inherently distributed nature of MAS. We propose that introducing a minimal set of agent-related concepts into the Distributed Systems (DS) domain can improve the engineering of modern MAS by leveraging techniques from DS engineering with established agent theory. In this study, we recapitulated the common origins of MAS and DS by drawing architectural parallels to establish a unified engineering approach. We then defined a minimal set of agent concepts to perform two practical studies on leveraging MAS development. First, we incorporated these concepts into a DS architectural pattern to design a distributed MAS. We then used these concepts in a graduate course to teach MAS engineering to students with no prior knowledge of agent theory. The learning outcomes from both courses included successful MAS implementation using DS tools and techniques. Although more than two-thirds of these students had no practical experience in developing distributed systems, the average final grade in both courses was above 80%, thus validating our approach. Finally, we discuss how this study supports the development of advanced systems using modern AI techniques consistently with established agent-related research while leveraging established DS techniques and concepts.",,,
Performance Monitoring-Enabled Reliable AI-Based CSI Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750249/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in channel state information (CSI) feedback tasks. Although current research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy through innovative AI approaches, the reliability of these systems in real-world scenarios often goes overlooked. Specifically, a closer examination of the feedback accuracy of individual CSI samples reveals significant variations, underscoring the imperative need for performance monitoring of AI-based CSI feedback. Building upon this observation, we introduce a pragmatic framework for AI-based CSI feedback. This process involves assessing feedback accuracy (i.e., conducting performance monitoring) on the user side before transmitting the CSI codeword. In particular, this method utilizes a lightweight proxy decoder, trained via knowledge distillation, to emulate the mapping function of the original decoder at the base station. The goal is to generate, at the user end, CSI identical to that produced at the base station by the original, more powerful decoder, thus enable precise prediction of feedback accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed performance monitoring method can precisely predict feedback accuracy with low complexity and accurately detect low-quality feedback samples with a detection rate of nearly 95%, ensuring reliable transmission.",,,

Compressing Neural Networks on Limited Computing Resources,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988545/,"Network compression is a crucial technique for applying deep learning models to edge or mobile devices. However, the cost of achieving higher benchmark performance through compression is continuously increasing, making network compression a significant burden—especially for small industries focused on developing compact models. Specifically, existing network compression techniques often require extensive computational resources, rendering them impractical for edge devices and small-scale applications. To democratize network compression, we propose a general-purpose framework that combines novel filter pruning and knowledge distillation techniques. First, unlike conventional filter pruning methods based on static heuristics and costly neural architecture search (NAS)-based approaches, our method leverages meta-learning for rapid and fine examination of the importance of each gate. This enables rapid and stable sub-network discovery, significantly improving the pruning process. Second, to minimize the computational cost of knowledge distillation, we introduce a synthetic teacher assistant that leverages precomputed fixed knowledge—referring to the stored feature maps/logits of the teacher network. By leveraging fixed knowledge, we mitigate the cost incurred by the teacher network and facilitate the transmission of fixed knowledge to the student via synthetic teacher assistants, thereby preventing distribution collapse. Our proposed framework dramatically reduces the compression overhead while maintaining high accuracy, achieving a 55.2% reduction in FLOPs of ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet while preserving 76.2% top-1 accuracy with only 199 GPU hours—significantly lower than previous state-of-the-art methods.

ARC: A Layer Replacement Compression Method Based on Fine-Grained Self-Attention Distillation for Compressing Pre-Trained Language Models,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663832/,"The primary objective of model compression is to maintain the performance of the original model while reducing its size as much as possible. Knowledge distillation has become the mainstream method in the field of model compression due to its excellent performance. However, current knowledge distillation methods for medium and small pre-trained models struggle to effectively extract knowledge from large pre-trained models. Similarly, methods targeting large pre-trained models face challenges in compressing the model to a smaller scale. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model compression method called Attention-based Replacement Compression (ARC), which introduces layer random replacement based on fine-grained self-attention distillation. This method first obtains the important features of the original model through fine-grained self-attention distillation in the pre-training distillation stage. More information can be obtained by extracting the upper layers of the large teacher model. Then, the one-to-one Transformer-layer random replacement training fully explores the hidden knowledge of the large pre-trained model in the fine-tuning compression stage. Compared with other complex compression methods, ARC not only simplifies the training process of model compression but also enhances the applicability of the compressed model. This paper compares knowledge distillation methods for pre-trained models of different sizes on the GLUE benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements across different parameter scales, especially in terms of accuracy and inference speed.",,,
Teachers’ Disappointment: Theoretical Perspective on the Inclusion of Ambivalent Emotions in Human-Robot Interactions in Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9484256/,"Following affective turn in cognitive science, recent decades have witnessed an increasing interest toward the role of emotions in education. Ample evidence suggests that learners and teachers experience a variety of emotions, ranging from joy and pride to anger and frustration. However, when it comes to the design of affective behavior in robotic systems for education purposes, the emphasis has been predominantly on communication of positive emotions. While we recognize that positive emotions are fundamental to successful learning, in this paper we wish to make the case for the consideration of ambivalent emotions for the design of social robots for tutoring. To ground this proposal, we focus on the emotion of teachers’ disappointment. First, we discuss under which conditions communicated teachers’ disappointment, while it may be experienced as emotionally ambivalent by teachers and students, functions as an affiliating pedagogical strategy. We proceed to sketch out the methodological suggestions we consider relevant for future studies of communicated disappointment in human-robot interactions within learning contexts.

An AI system for evaluating pass fail in fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery from live video in realtime with performative feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10385428/,"Medical students preparing to be a surgeon are required to demonstrate proficiency in laparoscopic surgery as part of their training. This is done via simulation on a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) kit where the student has to use graspers to transfer six rings from one set of pegs to another and then again back to the original set of pegs without dropping the peg. A peg dropped outside the box is considered a fail but a drop inside is the box is allowed as long as the transfer resumes with the correct grasper. We present an AI system that automatically determines if a student has passed or failed the FLS test. Our system uses an underlying YOLO model to detect the FLS box, the left and right graspers, and the FLS pegs and rings. We then use logic on top of this to detect events such as pick peg from ring, transfer peg between grapsers, and place peg on ring. We are also able to detect if the grasper drops the peg inside or outside the box (the latter being an automatic fail) and if the dropped peg was picked with the correct or wrong grasper. Our system detects these events in realtime without looking into future frames of the video - this means it can give performative feedback to the student as they are performing the task. To evaluate our system we trained it on 6 videos of junior medical residents performing FLS containing several instances of dropping pegs plus 1 video of a fake FLS showing deliberate drops across the board - this is so that the model can learn to identify drops. To evaluate our model we tested it on 14 videos on which our model correctly predicted pass fail on 11 - giving an accuracy of 78.6%. Compared to previous work our system requires only one camera, detects drops inside and outside the FLS box, produces a fully automated pass fail determination, and gives live performative feedback as the student is performing the task - thus informing them of their mistakes in realtime.",,,

Class Incremental Learning for Visual Task using Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9972924/,"The Artificial Agent's ability to enhance knowledge incrementally for new data is challenging in class incremental learning because of catastrophic forgetting in which new classes make the trained model quickly forget old classes knowledge.

These techniques allow models to sustain their knowledge without forgetting everything they already know but somewhat alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this study we propose class incremental learning using bi-distillation (CILBD) method that effectively learn not only the classes of the new data but also previously learned classes. The proposed architecture uses knowledge distillation in such a way that the student model directly learns knowledge from two teacher model and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class.

Advancing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Course Evaluation: A Multi-Task Learning Framework With Selective Paraphrasing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10833605/,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is essential for extracting valuable perspectives from textual data, particularly within educational contexts where understanding student feedback is vital for course evaluation. Multi-task Learning (MTL) models, which concurrently learn several related tasks, have shown promise in enhancing the performance of ABSA by leveraging shared representations. This research explores using MTL with three prominent pre-trained language models (PLMs): MTL-BERT, MTL-RoBERTa, and MTL-XLNet. To further enhance ABSA performance, we integrate a data augmentation method—selective paraphrasing—with the MTL-based PLMs, including SP-MTL-BERT, SP-MTL-RoBERTa, and SP-MTL-XLNet, aimed at enriching the training dataset without compromising the integrity of aspect terms. Additionally, a nuance control mechanism is integrated into the selective paraphrasing process to preserve sentiment intensity and polarity, ensuring semantic consistency and minimizing unintended sentiment drift in the augmented data. However, the scarcity of diverse and comprehensive training data can hinder the effectiveness of these models. For this study, we develop a custom academic dataset by collecting student feedback data on course evaluations comprising more than 11,000 comments from a public university. We conducted experiments on MTL-based models for the two sub-tasks of ABSA, aspect extraction, and sentiment classification, both with and without the integration of selective paraphrasing. The experimental findings indicate that our approach substantially improves performance across all models. Specifically, the SP-MTL-BERT model achieved the highest performance, showing an improvement of +11.0 in aspect recall, +10.8 in aspect F1-score, and +3.7 in sentiment precision, establishing it as the best-performing model in our study. Moreover, comparative analysis with baseline approaches and other data augmentation techniques, such as back translation and easy data augmentation, demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach, particularly in improving aspect classification recall and F1 scores.",,,

Chatbots are a novel type of human-machine interface that uses natural language. On the other hand, academic chatbots have received little attention in the academic community, for example, by providing organisational help for studies, courses, and tests. This research paper will focus on developing an AI-powered chatbot that will utilise A.I.M.L. (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) to answer students, guardians, parents, and observers. AMUBOT is a university chatbot that can conduct amicable chats about courses offered, admission requirements, scholarships, career guidance, semester examination dates and schedules, and entrance examinations, among other things, and can also answer frequently asked questions (FAQs). The majority of existing chatbots lack empathy and cannot accommodate anything that deviates from the script. AMUBOT addresses these issues by incorporating active learning into the implementation of existing chatbots.",,,
Research on Music Course Teaching Resource Recommendation based on Convolutional Neural Network,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11070589/,"The fast development of online education calls for smart recommendation systems that can improve personalized music learning experiences. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Multi-Modal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based recommendation model that can be specifically designed for the teaching resources of music courses. Current recommendation systems are plagued by low accuracy, poor contextual understanding, and limited adaptability to the distinctive auditory and structural properties of music-oriented data. Classic models like collaborative filtering and content-based ones tend to be ineffective in representing profound semantic relations between musical resources. However, the proposed architecture digs out hierarchical features from multi-modal music data (textual, audio, and visual inputs) to predict learner preferences accurately and provide relevant recommendations. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed model performs better than baseline models such as conventional CNNs and matrix factorization methods, reaching 94.2% accuracy and 93.5% F1-score, with superior performance in precision and recall trade-offs. The model's resilience and flexibility attest to its applicability in practical situations in dynamic learning environments, providing an intelligent and effective means for resource recommendation in music learning.",,,
Unveiling the invisible struggles: Exploring student perspectives on mental health in universities,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777542/,"In the current academic environment, the increasing prevalence of stress among students has become a critical concern, significantly affecting both mental health and academic outcomes. Factors such as heavy academic workloads, interpersonal conflicts, financial challenges, and societal pressures contribute to cognitive impairments, procrastination, and declining academic performance. Unaddressed, this stress can escalate into severe mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and self-harming tendencies, with marginalized or overwhelmed students being particularly vulnerable. Familial expectations, financial instability, imposter syndrome, fear of missing out, cyberbullying, and unsupportive institutional cultures further intensify these challenges. While mental health support mechanisms exist within institutions, they often remain reactive, addressing issues only after they manifest. To address this growing crisis, a shift toward proactive measures is essential, encompassing counseling, meditation, peer support systems, and engagement in extracurricular activities to foster emotional resilience. A holistic and preventative approach that emphasizes early intervention, open communication, and supportive academic environments is imperative to promote students' well-being and academic success.",,,
A Novelty Real-Time Gesture Recognition Model for Air-Hand Piano Playing Using Mediapipe,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10793028/,"This paper proposes an artificial intelligence model designed to identify the positions of the fingers on the hands, assigning them corresponding musical notes. The creation of this model involved the development of a custom dataset comprising various hand configurations, each specifying how a person mimics pressing a piano key. To expand the volume of data and improve its variety, data augmentation was used, a technique that helps the model perform more efficiently under various conditions of use. The data processing included normalization of the coordinates relative to the wrist, so that aspects such as the size, color or shape of the hands do not influence the performance of the model, and the actual position of the hands is independent of the distance from the camera. Another innovative aspect of the development was the application of contrastive learning, whereby the model distinguishes between correct and incorrect hand positions, forming pairs of similar data and minimizing the distances between their coordinates. The results show that the model achieved a high performance for hand gesture classification with an accuracy of 98.89%.",,,

Building Ontology-Driven Tutoring Models for Intelligent Tutoring Systems Using Data Mining,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031710/,"Pedagogical (Tutor or Tutoring) Models are an important element of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and they can be described by sets of (tutoring) rules. The implementation of a Tutoring Model includes both the formal representation of the aforementioned rules and a mechanism able to interpret such representation and execute the rules. One of the most suitable approaches to formally represent pedagogical rules is to construct semantic web ontologies that are highly interoperable and can be integrated with other models in an ITS like the subject domain and the student model. However, the main drawback of semantic web-based approaches is that they require a considerable human effort to prepare and build relevant ontologies. This paper proposes a novel approach to maintain the benefits of the semantic web-based approach in representing pedagogical rules for an ITS, while overcoming its main drawback by employing a data mining technique to automatically extract rules from real-world tutoring sessions and represent them by means of Web Ontology Language (OWL).",,,

Decoupling Teaching Ability in Meta Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386647/,"Knowledge distillation (KD) effectively solves the problem of difficulty in deploying and using pre-trained language models (PLMs) with numerous parameters for non-AI researchers such as sociologists. The integration of meta-learning and knowledge distillation enables teacher models to transfer their expertise to smaller student models with lower knowledge transfer loss. However, this approach introduces the challenge of excessive optimization parameters compared to vanilla distillation methods. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient knowledge distillation framework that incorporates the Teacher Teaching Module/Student Feedback Module and gradient pruning to decouple the teaching ability and feature representation of the teacher model, allowing a more focused enhancement of teaching abilities without compromising feature representation capabilities. Additionally, we optimize a meta distillation method, which increases the optimization speed of the student model by about twice. Experimental evaluations conducted on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves test scores comparable to previous methods while utilizing less than 2% of teacher parameter updates and 50% of student. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on select datasets relevant to sociological research, showcasing the ability of our compact model to provide higher results at a significantly reduced computational cost, thereby serving the needs of sociologists more efficiently.",,,

Detect Any Mirrors: Boosting Learning Reliability on Large-Scale Unlabeled Data with an Iterative Data Engine,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11093986/,"Mirror detection is a challenging task because a mirror’s visual appearance varies depending on the reflected content. Due to limited annotated data, current methods failed to generalize well for detecting diverse mirror scenes. Semi-supervised learning with large-scale unlabeled data can improve generalization capabilities on mirror detection, but these methods often suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels due to distribution differences between labeled and unlabeled data, therefore affecting the learning process. To address this issue, we first collect a large-scale dataset of approximately 0.4 million mirror-related images from the internet, significantly expanding the data scale for mirror detection. To effectively exploit this unlabeled dataset, we propose the first semi-supervised framework (namely an iterative data engine) consisting of four steps: (1) mirror detection model training, (2) pseudo label prediction, (3) dual guidance scoring, and (4) selection of highly reliable pseudo labels. In each iteration of the data engine, we employ a geometric accuracy scoring approach to assess pseudo labels based on multiple segmentation metrics, and design a multi-modal agent-driven semantic scoring approach to enhance the semantic perception of pseudo labels. These two scoring approaches can effectively improve the reliability of pseudo labels by selecting unlabeled samples with higher scores. Our method demonstrates promising performance across three mirror detection tasks and exhibits strong generalization on unseen examples.

Federated Policy Distillation for Digital Twin-Enabled Intelligent Resource Trading in 5G Network Slicing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711938/,"Resource sharing in radio access networks (RAN) can be conceptualized as a resource trading process between infrastructure providers (InPs) and multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), where InPs lease essential network resources, such as spectrum and infrastructure, to MVNOs. Given the dynamic nature of RANs, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a more suitable approach to decision-making and resource optimization that ensures adaptive and efficient resource allocation strategies. In RAN slicing, DRL struggles due to imbalanced data distribution and reliance on high-quality training data. In addition, the trade-off between the global solution and individual agent goals can lead to oscillatory behavior, preventing convergence to an optimal solution. Therefore, we propose a collaborative intelligent resource trading framework with a graph-based digital twin (DT) for multiple InPs and MVNOs based on Federated DRL. First, we present a customized mutual policy distillation scheme for resource trading, where complex MVNO teacher policies are distilled into InP student models and vice versa. This mutual distillation encourages collaboration to achieve personalized resource trading decisions that reach the optimal local and global solution. Second, the DT uses a graph-based model to capture the dynamic interactions between InPs and MVNOs to improve resource-trade decisions. DT can accurately predict resource prices and demand from MVNO to provide high-quality training data. In addition, DT identifies the underlying patterns and trends through advanced analytics, enabling proactive resource allocation and pricing strategies.

Graph Knowledge Structure for Attentional Knowledge Tracing With Self-Supervised Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812715/,"As intelligent education advances and online learning becomes more prevalent, Knowledge Tracing (KT) has become increasingly important. KT assesses students’ learning progress by analysing their historical performance in related exercises. Despite significant advances in the field, there are still shortcomings in two aspects: first, a lack of effective integration between exercises and knowledge points; second, an overemphasis on nodal information, neglecting deep semantic relationships.

Diffusion-Assisted Distillation for Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning with MLPs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124524/,"For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model’s inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-Assisted Distillation for Self-supervised Graph representation learning with MLPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation methods.

Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A User Study on the ChatGPT’s Fake Information Impact,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183726/,"Technological evolution has enabled the development of new artificial intelligence (AI) models with generative capabilities. Among them, one of the most discussed is the virtual agent ChatGPT. This chatbot may occasionally produce fake information, as also declared by the producer OpenAI. Such a model may provide very useful support in several tasks, ranging from text summarization to programming. The research community has marginally investigated the impact that fake information created by AI models has on the users’ perceptions and on their belief in AI. We analyzed the impact of the fake information produced by AI on user perceptions, specifically trust and satisfaction, by performing a user study on ChatGPT. An additional issue is assessing whether the early or late knowledge of the possibility of the tool generating fake information has a different impact on the users’ perceptions. We conducted an experiment, involving 62 university students, a category of users who may employ tools such as ChatGPT extensively. The experiment consisted of a guided interaction with ChatGPT. Some of the participants experienced the failure of the chatbot, while a control group only received correct and reliable answers. We collected participants’ perceptions of trust, satisfaction, and usability, together with the net promoter score (NPS). The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in trust and satisfaction between the users who early experienced fake information production compared to those who discovered ChatGPT’s faulty behaviors later during the interaction. Also, there is no statistically significant difference among the users who received the late fake information and the control group (no fake information). Usability and the NPS also resulted higher when the fake news was detected in the late interaction. When users are aware of the fake information generated by ChatGPT their trust and satisfaction decrease, especially when they impact on this at the early stage of use of the chatbot. Nevertheless, the perception of trust and satisfaction still remains high, as some of the users are still enthusiastic; others consider a more conscious use of the tool in terms of support to be verified. A useful strategy could be to favor a critical use of ChatGPT, letting young people to verify the provided information. This should be a new way to perform learning activities.",,,

Distributional Shift Adaptation using Domain-Specific Features,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10020444/,"Machine learning algorithms typically assume that the training and test samples come from the same distributions, i.e., in-distribution. However, in open-world scenarios, streaming big data can be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD), rendering these algorithms ineffective. Prior solutions to the OOD challenge seek to identify invariant features across different training domains. The underlying assumption is that these invariant features should also work reasonably well in the unlabeled target domain. By contrast, this work is interested in the domain-specific features that include both invariant features and features unique to the target domain. We propose a simple yet effective approach that relies on correlations in general regardless of whether the features are invariant or not. Our approach uses the most confidently predicted samples identified by an OOD base model (teacher model) to train a new model (student model) that effectively adapts to the target domain. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the performance is improved over the SOTA by ∼10-20%.",,,

ChatGPT and Software Testing Education: Promises & Perils,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132255/,"Over the past decade, predictive language modeling for code has proven to be a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More recently, we have seen the ad-vent of general purpose ""large language models"", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text, which includes code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users.The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. We found that given its current capabilities, ChatGPT is able to respond to 77.5% of the questions we examined and that, of these questions, it is able to provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct answers and explanations.

Decoupling Dark Knowledge via Block-Wise Logit Distillation for Feature-Level Alignment,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10780970/,"Knowledge distillation (KD), a learning manner with a larger teacher network guiding a smaller student network, transfers dark knowledge from the teacher to the student via logits or intermediate features, with the aim of producing a well-performed lightweight model. Notably, many subsequent feature-based KD methods outperformed the earliest logit-based KD method and iteratively generated numerous state-of-the-art distillation methods. Nevertheless, recent work has uncovered the potential of the logit-based method, bringing the simple KD form based on logits back into the limelight. Features or logits? They partially implement the KD with entirely distinct perspectives; therefore, choosing between logits and features is not straightforward. This article provides a unified perspective of feature alignment to obtain a better comprehension of their fundamental distinction. Inheriting the design philosophy and insights of feature-based and logit-based methods, we introduce a block-wise logit distillation framework to apply implicit logit-based feature alignment by gradually replacing teacher's blocks as intermediate stepping-stone models to bridge the gap between the student and the teacher.

A Transformer-Based Educational Virtual Assistant Using Diacriticized Latin Script,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225737/,"A virtual assistant or smart chatbot should be able to understand user questions and respond correctly and usefully, even if the questions are posed ungrammatically with misspellings and other errors. This paper describes the design and construction of a text-to-text virtual assistant in Vietnamese, a language that uses the Latin script with a liberal use of diacritics, for supporting students at a large university with over forty thousand students. The flexible virtual assistant consists of two integrated chatbots, both using Transformers: a) a closed-domain chatbot, trained on over thirty-five thousand factual question-answer pairs to engage in university-related conversation, and b) a second open-domain chatbot, trained on a large movie dialog dataset to engage in general conversation. The integrated virtual assistant classifies a question as either factual or general, and engages the appropriate chatbot to respond in a flexible, appropriate and natural manner. Although Vietnamese uses diacritics copiously, even educated users have a propensity to forgo the use of diacritics, and as a result, to facilitate smooth text-based communication, our design includes extensive pre-processing that uses learned Transformers to restore missing diacritics and correct misspellings. Our Transformer models outperform existing approaches for diacritic restoration and are better than several other methods for spelling correction in Vietnamese.

Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Object Detection via Adaptive Pseudo Labeling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208219/,"Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with limited annotated examples. Mainstream methods suffer from the data scarcity of novel classes with insufficient intra-class variations, which makes the trained model biased to base classes. Actually, there are massive unlabeled novel instances in the base dataset and their adequate utilization will enhance the discriminability of model to novel classes. This paper proposes a semi-supervised few-shot object detection method, which utilizes a teacher model and a pre-trained few-shot object detector to guide the learning of a student model through adaptive pseudo labeling. In particular, a class-adaptive threshold filtering (CATF) strategy is designed to deal with the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels. And for each novel class, the threshold to select valuable pseudo labels is determined by quantile statistics of the confidence score distribution of pseudo labels. Furthermore, the pre-trained detector and the teacher model are associated with the preliminary CATF and in-depth CATF, respectively, and then the pseudo labels from the two-stream CATF are fused to provide supervisions. In this way, the knowledge of these two models is exploited, which improves the quality of pseudo labels. Under these supervisions, the student model is trained and the teacher model is correspondingly updated through parameters sharing, thus forming a positive feedback to improve the performance of both models. Besides, an attention module is integrated to the teacher and student models to enhance the feature representation of novel instances.

Dual-Channel Knowledge Tracing With Self-Supervised Contrastive and Directed Interaction Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891379/,"With the widespread adoption of the internet, intelligent tutoring systems have experienced rapid advancements in education. Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict students’ future performance by modeling their behavioral sequences. While existing models have made notable progress in some areas, challenges remain in fully uncovering the higher-order relationships among exercises, concepts, and students. To address these limitations and effectively capture the intricate dependencies between learning behaviors and exercises, this paper introduces a novel approach: Dual-Channel Knowledge Tracing with Self-Supervised Contrastive and Directed Interaction Learning (SCDI). This method enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging graph-structured embeddings of interaction data, offering a more comprehensive analysis of the learning process. SCDI consists of two distinct channels. The first channel constructs a heterogeneous graph with student, exercise, and concept nodes, using a Meta-path Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to extract high-order information from exercise and concept nodes. It also incorporates a self-supervised graph contrastive learning mechanism to improve the quality of node embeddings. The second channel builds a directed graph from interaction sequences, using Graph Attention Convolution (GATC) to capture dynamic relationships and model how interactions evolve over time. Features from both channels are integrated and passed to a downstream KT model to predict students’ future performance. Experimental evaluations on four datasets demonstrate that SCDI significantly enhances the accuracy of downstream KT models, establishing its effectiveness and robustness.",,,

Enhancing Adaptive Learning with Deep Neural Networks for Personalized Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11194156/,"This study presents a comprehensive deep learning framework that significantly advances personalized learning technologies, particularly its focus on intelligent systems and human-centered computing, Many existing adaptive educational systems struggle to integrate cognitive models, curriculum structures, and temporal learning patterns. As a result, their adaptability and interpretability are often limited when applied to diverse learner profiles. Traditional approaches generally lack robustness in handling sparse, noisy interaction data and often ignore pedagogical signals critical to effective guidance.

A Study on the Impact of a Statics Sketch-Based Tutoring System Through a Truss Design Problem,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274208/,"Providing opportunities for students to exercise their creative skills in large, entry engineering classes challenges most faculty. This paper presents a study of a large statics class provided with a homework problem that asks them to design a truss structure. Automatic grading was done by Mechanix, an AI tutor-based software package that can automatically recognize a free-body diagram or a planar, 2d, statically determinate truss structure. The paper presents a study done in two different semesters, comparing the students using Mechanix to a control (problem on paper). To ease grading, the control group's trusses were analyzed by Mechanix after submission. No mean homework grade differences were observed, but students in the Mechanix group produced trusses that could withstand higher loads. This is despite the fact the only guidance or feedback Mechanix provides was if the students' calculated max load was correct, and if it was not, which member failed. This study occurred in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. Students also submitted more attempts in Mechanix than the control. It may be students in the control group only submitted correct answers despite being asked to submit all attempts. Future work will provide more incentive for students to submit all attempts on paper. Mechanix automatically records all attempts. During high stress (Covid-19), more students in the Mechanix group submitted the assignment indicating that students may find this system less mentally taxing to use, less stressful, or something else led to this difference. It will be explored with focus groups in the future.

Development and Field-Testing of a Non-intrusive Classroom Attention Tracking System (NiCATS) for Tracking Student Attention in CS Classrooms,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9962447/,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our Non-intrusive Classroom Attention Tracking System (NiCATS) and discusses the data collected through it. Academic instructors and institutions desire the ability to accurately and autonomously measure students' attentiveness in the classroom. Generally, college departments use unreliable direct communication from students, observational sit-ins, and end-of-semester surveys to collect feedback regarding their courses. Each of these methods of collecting feedback is useful but does not provide automatic feedback regarding the pace and direction of lectures. It has been widely reported that attention levels during passive classroom lectures generally drop after about ten to thirty minutes and can be restored to normal levels with regular breaks, novel activities, mini-lectures, case studies, or videos. Tracking these “drops” in attention can be crucial for the accurate timing of these change-ups in activities. This allows for maximal attention and a greater amount of deeply learned material. Autonomously collected data can also be used either in real-time or post-hoc to alter the design and presentation of lectures. Keeping track of student attention is vital to having confidence in delivering material. Even if lectures do not break up presentation slides with attention-raising activities, they can still show more important information during periods of high attention and less important information during periods of low attention. This area of research has applications both in in-person classrooms and online learning environments. The long-term goals of this research can prove invaluable for large in-person classrooms or classrooms where students’ faces are obscured, such as behind computer monitors.",,,

A Replaceable Curiosity-Driven Candidate Agent Exploration Approach for Task-Oriented Dialog Policy Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681405/,"Task-oriented dialog policy learning is often formulated as a Reinforcement Learning problem whose rewards from the environment are extremely sparse, which means that the agent will often not find the reward by acting randomly. Thus, exploration techniques are of primary importance when solving RL problems, and more sophisticated exploration methods must be devised. In this study, we propose a replaceable curiosity-driven candidate agent exploration approach to encourage the agent to balance action sampling and explore new environments without overly violating dialog strategies. In this framework, we follow the employment of the curiosity model but design weight for the curiosity reward to balance exploration and exploitation. We designed a multi-candidate agent mechanism to filter an agent with relatively balanced action sampling for formal dialog training to motivate agents to escape pseudo-optimal actions in the early training stage. In addition, we propose a replacement mechanism for the first time to prevent the elected agents from performing poorly in the later stages of training and to fully utilize all the candidate agents. The experimental results show that the adjustable curiosity reward promotes dialog policy convergence. The agent replacement mechanism effectively blocks the training of poorly trained agents, significantly increasing the task’s average success rate and reducing the number of dialog turns. In this research, an exploration approach for task-oriented dialog system is designed to encourage agents to explore environment through balanced action sampling, without significantly deviating from learned dialog strategies.

TPE-ADE: Thumbnail-Preserving Encryption Based on Adaptive Deviation Embedding for JPEG Images,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366821/,"The growing practice of outsourcing captured photos to the cloud has provided users with convenience while also raising privacy concerns. Traditional image encryption techniques prioritize privacy protection but often compromise usability, which is unacceptable for cloud users. To strike a balance between image privacy and usability, scholars have proposed thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE), whose cipher image preserves the same thumbnail as the plain image while erasing details beyond the thumbnail, providing visual usability while protecting privacy. Regrettably, most of the proposed TPE schemes are not well-suited for widely used JPEG images, and existing TPE schemes supporting JPEG suffer from drawbacks such as poor visual usability, high expansion rate, and the inability to decrypt without loss. Besides, the retrieval designed for TPE-encrypted images exhibits limited generalization. To address these challenges, we pertinently introduce a TPE based on adaptive deviation embedding (TPE-ADE) for JPEG images, incorporating Huffman coding and reversible data hiding techniques. By leveraging JPEG in-compression encryption, we achieve perfectly reversible TPE that enhances visual usability and reduces expansion rates of TPE-encrypted images. Additionally, we encourage the TPE-encrypted images to resemble low-resolution images (LRIs). Then, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to recognize and retrieve LRIs to verify the functionality of TPE-encrypted images.

Motion-Based Educational Games: Using Multi-Modal Data to Predict Player’s Performance,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231892/,"Multi-Modal Data (MMD) can help educational games researchers understand the synergistic relationship between player's movement and their learning experiences, and consequently uncover insights that may lead to improved design of movement-based game technologies for learning. Predicting player performance fosters opportunities to cultivate heightened educational experiences and outcomes. However, predicting player's performance utilising player-generated MMD during their interactions with educational Motion-Based Touchless Games (MBTG) is challenging. To bridge this gap, we implemented an in-situ study where 26 users, age 11, played 2 maths MBTGs in a single 20-30 minute session. We collected player's MMD (i.e., gaze data from eye-tracking glasses, physiological data from wristbands, and skeleton data from Kinect) produced during game-play. To investigate the potential of MMD for predicting player's academic performance, we used machine learning techniques and MMD derived from player's game-play. This allowed us to identify the MMD features that drive rapid highly accurate predictions of players' academic performance in educational MBTGs. This might allow us to provide real-time proactive feedback to the player to support them through their educational gaming experience.

Multi Step Knowledge Distillation Framework For Action Recognition in Still Images,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475221/,"Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a challenging computer vision task due to issues like lack of temporal information, significant intra-class variations, cluttered backgrounds, and misleading objects. A straightforward solution to cope with these challenges is to fine-tune complex deep neural networks that have been properly pre-trained on large scale datasets, such as Image-Net. Nevertheless, these models are computationally inefficient, making them unsuitable for real-world applications. One of the most popular approaches to this problem is knowledge distillation. It involves transferring knowledge from large network to computationally efficient model. Typically, these two networks are referred to as student and teacher networks. Furthermore, several studies have shown that despite stronger models providing more robust guiding signals for the training of student model, the substantial computational gap between student and teacher networks can negatively impact knowledge transfer. To deal with these issues, we propose an innovative multi step knowledge distillation framework that takes advantage of a mid-size teacher assistant network to narrow the computational gap between student and teacher networks. Also, self-distillation is used to improve teacher network performance, which in turn increases student network accuracy. Three variants of EfficientNetV2 are used to construct teacher, teacher assistant, and student networks. According to the results, based on Mean Average Precision (MAP) the student model performance on the Standford-40 dataset improved from 94.75% to 96.30% by employing the proposed knowledge distillation framework, which is better than the results reported by previous studies.",,,

Beyond Scores: A Modular RAG-Based System for Automatic Short Answer Scoring With Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771759/,"Automatic short answer scoring (ASAS) helps reduce the grading burden on educators but often lacks detailed, explainable feedback. Existing methods in ASAS with feedback (ASAS-F) rely on fine-tuning language models with limited datasets, which is resource-intensive and struggles to generalize across contexts. Recent approaches using large language models (LLMs) have focused on scoring without extensive fine-tuning. However, they often rely heavily on prompt engineering and either fail to generate elaborated feedback or do not adequately evaluate it.

On the Challenges and Opportunities of Using ChatGPT in Academia,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343189/,"When it comes to advanced language models, ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, is a standout chatbot that proves to be highly effective in various academic settings. Its ability to generate responses that resemble human ones and offer detailed answers makes it a valuable resource for educational purposes. While its use has potential drawbacks, such as the risk of academic dishonesty, this paper investigates the pros and cons of implementing ChatGPT in educational settings, particularly in engineering and computer science. Through an in-depth evaluation of its effectiveness, the article suggests measures to minimize the likelihood of cheating. ChatGPT presents a promising tool for enhancing students' learning experiences in these fields. ChatGPT's implementation in academia faces many challenges as it becomes essential to consider its pros, cons, and limitations. On the positive side, students can significantly benefit from its ability to help them understand complex concepts, generate questions, and find detailed solutions for their assignments. Educators can also use ChatGPT to provide personalized learning experiences, including immediate feedback and context-based questions. However, a significant concern is the potential for academic dishonesty. Since ChatGPT can produce responses that resemble human-generated ones, students may be tempted to misuse it to cheat on their work, such as writing essays or exam answers. This poses a challenge for educators in identifying plagiarism. Additionally, there is a risk that ChatGPT could be used to create false references or provide inaccurate information. To mitigate the risk of cheating, professors can take several approaches. A possible solution is to educate students about the appropriate use of ChatGPT and incorporate it into the classroom to emphasize its educational value. Another method is to use anti-plagiarism software that can detect if ChatGPT generates the student's work. However, anti-plagiarism software may have varying degrees of success in detecting ChatGPT-generated text. Since ChatGPT creates text that can be very similar to human-generated text, it may be challenging for the software to differentiate between the two. However, some anti-plagiarism software may be designed to recognize patterns in the text that are indicative of machine-generated content, and they may flag such content as potentially plagiarized. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of anti-plagiarism software depends on the type of software being used, its capabilities, and the sophistication of the methods used to generate the text. Additionally, since ChatGPT can generate context-based and original text, it may be more challenging for anti-plagiarism software to detect plagiarism. A new transformation is required for anti-plagiarism software to detect AI-generated texts effectively. Therefore, while anti-plagiarism software may be helpful in detecting some instances of plagiarism, it may not be a foolproof method of detecting ChatGPT-generated text. In Conclusion, while ChatGPT has the potential to be a valuable tool in academia, there are potential negative implications, such as the risk of cheating. Educators must be aware of these risks and take measures to mitigate them.",,,
Bayesian Knowledge Tracing based on Transformer,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9908959/,"Knowledge tracing (KT) is a crucial technique for modelling learners in intelligent education. Deep learning has been applied to knowledge tracing to improve the tracing accuracy of the model substantially. However, compared with traditional knowledge tracing methods, deep knowledge tracing lacks effective feedback to teachers or students. The connection between the input data features and the output tracing results cannot be well explained. It is challenging to predict students' performance in the future period based on a small number of samples in practice. In this paper, we propose a deep knowledge tracing model based on Bayesian inference (TBKT). Specifically, a priori data subsets are formed by sampling the training data, and data augmentation is performed on the data subsets by Bayesian regression. The model is trained to approximate the Bayesian posterior distribution based on a small subset combined with query data. The model is trained on the ASSISTments2009 dataset with interpretability and achieves an AUC metric similar to the original transformer.",,,

How to Mislead AI-Assisted Network Automation in SD-IPoEONs: A Comparison Study of DRL- and GAN-Based Approaches,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9122411/,"Recently, the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and software-defined networking (SDN) has attracted intensive research interests because it realizes and promotes AI-assisted network automation (AIaNA). Despite the initial successes of AIaNA, its vulnerabilities, i.e., the downside of the reduction of human involvement achieved by it, have not been carefully explored. In this work, we use software-defined IP over elastic optical networks (SD-IPoEONs) as the background, and study how to mislead the AIaNA system in them. Specifically, we target our attack on the deep neural network (DNN) based traffic predictor in the AIaNA system, and design an adversarial module (ADVM) that can craft and inject adversarial traffic samples adaptively to disturb its operation. We consider two approaches to design the ADVM, i.e., the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and the generative adversarial network (GAN) model. Our proposed ADVM can monitor and interact with a dynamic SD-IPoEON to train itself on-the-fly. This enables it to generate and inject adversarial samples in the most disturbing and hard-to-detect way and to severely affect the AIaNA's performance on multilayer service provisioning. Specifically, IP flows will be served incorrectly to result in unnecessary congestions/under-utilizations on lightpaths, and erroneous network reconfigurations will be invoked frequently. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our ADVM designs, and show that the GAN-based ADVM achieves better attack effects with smaller perturbation strength.",,,

Echo State Network Based on Improved Knowledge Distillation for Edge Intelligence,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10410578/,"Echo state network (ESN) as a novel artificial neural network has drawn much attention from time series prediction in edge intelligence. ESN is slightly insufficient in long-term memory, thereby impacting the prediction performance. It suffers from a higher computational overhead when deploying on edge devices. We firstly introduce the knowledge distillation into the reservoir structure optimization, and then propose the echo state network based on improved knowledge distillation (ESN-IKD) for edge intelligence to improve the prediction performance and reduce the computational overhead. The model of ESN-IKD is constructed with the classic ESN as a student network, the long and short-term memory network as a teacher network, and the ESN with double loop reservoir structure as an assistant network. The student network learns the long-term memory capability of the teacher network with the help of the assistant network. The training algorithm of ESN-IKD is proposed to correct the learning direction through the assistant network and eliminate the redundant knowledge through the iterative pruning. It can solve the problems of error learning and redundant learning in the traditional knowledge distillation process. Extensive experimental simulation shows that ESN-IKD has a good time series prediction performance in both long-term and short-term memory, and achieves a lower computational overhead.",,,
Balancing the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma with Online Stability Tuning for Continual Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9892055/,Balancing the stability-plasticity dilemma is an omnipresent challenge in continual learning. The dilemma is that the ability of a model to learn new knowledge (plasticity) comes at the expense of the ability to remember past knowledge (stability) and vice versa. Some continual learning algorithms incorporate a constant hyper-parameter to control this trade-off. We argue that the trade-off should be dynamically tuned rather than kept constant. We propose a method to dynamically balance stability and plasticity in a semi-online and fully online manner. Our method is applicable to a range of underlying regularisation based strategies and class incremental problems. Our experiments in three continual learning benchmarks suggest that dynamic stability tuning methods can improve accuracy and decrease forgetting of continual learning strategies throughout their lifetime.,,,

An Education Model for Game Development by A Swedish-Japanese Industry-Academia Alliance,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231558/,"This paper presents and evaluates a new educational tool and a model for learning theory and practice of game development, by involving geographically separated and culturally different industrial and academic organizations. We propose a TRIAD education model, which is as an extension to the conventional project-based learning, by uniting industry staff, faculty members, and students in an online discussion space. This model is a two-phase cyclic model where in Phase-1) industry members and academic staff discuss the progress of PBL transparently, showing the cross-cultural gaps and advising how to solve them, and in Phase-2) students make progress on the projects. Additionally, the TRIAD model adopts asynchronous text messaging as a core communication method, which is suitable for a multi-timezone situation, as well as exchanges of self-reviews from students and feedback from instructors. The online space not only facilitates interns in overcoming the hurdles represented by the gaps between the industry and academia, but it also visualizes the students' implicit educational progress by periodically analyzing all stored data by applying quantitative text analysis methods. This paper shows the result of an empirical study by utilizing this TRIAD model and analytics tool conducted at a large-scale Japanese game company with over 2,000 employees focusing on two students from the division of game development at a university in Sweden. We applied a quantitative text analysis tool for this model during an on-going internship program to clarify how students change their thoughts and behaviors by acquiring cross-cultural professionalism in the game industry.

Anglo-Bangla Language-Based AI Chatbot for Bangladeshi University Admission System,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242763/,"Many Bangladeshi students face significant challenges during university admission because of a lack of communication. However, some of the usual chatbots have been implemented in English/Bangla. Most students are comfortable communicating in a slang mixture of Bengali and English (Anglo-Bangla). This article presents a language detection model for Anglo-Bangla using machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multinomial Naive Bias (MNB). The model is designed to assist the university admission process in Bangladesh through an automated chatbot system. The chatbot system utilizes the language detection model to understand and respond to the queries of potential students in English, Bengali, and Anglo-Bangla. When the chatbot is unable to provide a proper answer in rare cases, the system logs the query along with user contact information. University officials will then update the appropriate response and the system will send the response to the user via email or SMS. The detector continuously detects the language and creates separate datasets to improve the chatbot’s performance. Our model was trained on a dataset of 0.15 million conversations collected from Socian Ltd., a leading NLP company. The dataset consisted of unlabeled Bangla and Anglo-Bangla languages and an English dataset collected from Kaggle, which was a mixed-language dataset. The model’s performance shows that the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm yields the highest accuracy in detecting the following languages: 99.64% for the Mixed, 99.13% for English, 100% for Bangla, and 99.51% for Anglo-Bangla.

A Novel Small-Sample Dense Teacher Assistant Knowledge Distillation Method for Bearing Fault Diagnosis,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10231110/,"Recently, deep learning models have been widely studied and applied in fault diagnosis. However, two common drawbacks are: 1) they usually require a large amount of storage resources, making it difficult to run them on embedded devices and 2) there is usually no access to sufficient reliable training data to train a comprehensive diagnosis model. In this study, a fusion approach is proposed based on knowledge distillation and generative adversarial network (GAN). This approach is named small-sample dense teacher assistant knowledge distillation (SS-DTAKD), which aims to enable bearing fault diagnosis with small samples and limited on-board storage resources. First, the proposed self-attention GAN (SGAN) is used to expand the training data for the diagnostic model. The advantage is that the generator and discriminator embedded with the self-attention module can help improve the quality of the generated data. Then, the DTAKD method is proposed to compress the model parameter, where the dense distillation of multiple teacher-assistant networks helps the student network learn correct knowledge without requiring additional data and storage resources. Additionally, the dual-type data hierarchical training (DDHT) method is applied to train the student network, which is designed to utilize actual data to improve the student network’s performance. Extensive experiments on two bearing fault datasets demonstrate that the data generated by the SGAN has high similarity and robustness. Furthermore, compared to other existing knowledge distillation methods, the proposed SS-DTAKD method can obtain higher fault diagnosis accuracy with small samples and limited on-board storage resources.",,,
"Oh No, Not Another Trolley! On the Need for a Co-Liberative Consciousness in CS Pedagogy",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9444345/,"Due to growing concerns for the disproportionate dangers, artificial intelligence (AI) advances pose to marginalized groups, proposals for procedural solutions to ethics in AI abound. It is time to consider that some systems may be inherently unethical, even violent, whether or not they are fair. In this article, we deploy a feminist critical discourse analysis of long-format responses to ethical scenarios from computing science undergraduate students. We find that even among students that had a strong understanding of social justice and the power of AI to exacerbate existing inequities, most students contextualize these problems as the product of biased datasets and human mis/trust factors, rather than as problems of design and purpose. Further, while many students recognized racism and classism at play in the potential negative impacts of AI systems, most students failed to recognize ableism as a driving social force for inequity. As computing science faculty, we must recognize that our students graduate to become the researchers and developers of future technosocial systems. Pedagogically, we need more than procedural fixes to systemic inequities. We are not going to program our way into justice. We must learn to say no to building violent things.",,,

Research on Intelligent Student Behavior Monitoring and Analysis Model based on Deep Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11138076/,"With the advancement of education informatization, intelligent education system plays an increasingly important role in the analysis and monitoring of student behavior. Student behavior monitoring and analysis can not only provide personalized learning support, but also provide data-driven decision basis for teaching optimization. This paper proposes an intelligent student behavior monitoring and analysis model based on noise reduction autoencoder (DAE) and deep neural network (DNN), which aims to effectively extract features and reduce dimensions of student behavior data through autoencoder, and use deep neural network to learn and predict behavior patterns. First of all, this paper uses noise reduction autoencoder to carry out unsupervised learning of students' behavior data, achieve efficient compression and feature representation of multi-dimensional behavior data, reduce data redundancy, and extract key features of students' behavior. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) model is constructed to input low-dimensional features processed by autoencoders into the network to capture the dynamic behavior patterns of students during the learning process. DNN effectively improves the ability of fitting and predicting complex behavior patterns through the nonlinear mapping ability of multi-layer hidden nodes. In the experimental part, this paper verifies the student behavior data in the real education scene, and the results show that the proposed model is superior to the traditional methods in the accuracy of student behavior analysis.

Towards Better Stability and Adaptability: Improve Online Self-Training for Model Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203421/,"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation transfers the knowledge of the source domain to the target one to improve the adaptability of the segmentation model in the target domain. The need to access labeled source data makes UDA unable to handle adaptation scenarios involving privacy, property rights protection, and confidentiality. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised model adaptation (UMA), also called source-free domain adaptation, which adapts a source-trained model to the target domain without accessing source data. We find that the online self-training method has the potential to be deployed in UMA, but the lack of source domain loss will greatly weaken the stability and adaptability of the method. We analyze two reasons for the degradation of online self-training, i.e. inopportune updates of the teacher model and biased knowledge from the source-trained model. Based on this, we propose a dynamic teacher update mechanism and a training-consistency based resampling strategy to improve the stability and adaptability of online self-training. On multiple model adaptation benchmarks, our method obtains new state-of-the-art performance, which is comparable or even better than state-of-the-art UDA methods.

D-MIMO is a technique by which a set of wireless access points are synchronized and grouped together to jointly serve multiple users simultaneously. This paper addresses two dynamic resource management problems germane to D-MIMO Wi-Fi networks: (i) channel assignment of D-MIMO groups, and (ii) deciding how to cluster access points to form D-MIMO groups, in order to maximize user throughput performance. These problems are known to be NP-Hard and only heuristic solutions exist in literature. We construct a DRL framework through which a learning agent interacts with a D-MIMO Wi-Fi network, learns about the network environment, and successfully converges to policies which address the aforementioned problems. Through extensive simulations and on-line training based on D-MIMO Wi-Fi networks, this paper demonstrates the efficacy of DRL agents in achieving an improvement of 20% in user throughput performance compared to heuristic solutions, particularly when network conditions are dynamic. This work also showcases the effectiveness of DRL agents in meeting multiple network objectives simultaneously, for instance, maximizing throughput of users as well as fairness of throughput among them.",,,

Besides, software security education has not been benefited by these patterns though a commonly stated motivation is the dissemination of expert knowledge and experience. This is because the patterns lack a simple embodiment to help students learn about vulnerable code, and to guide new developers on secure coding. In order to address this problem, we propose to conduct intelligent data mining in the context of software engineering to discover learner-friendly software security patterns. Our proposed model entails knowledge discovery from large scale published real-world vulnerability histories in software applications. We harness association rule mining for frequent pattern discovery to mine easily comprehensible and explainable learner-friendly rules, mainly of the type ""flaw implies fix"" and ""attack type implies flaw"", so as to enhance training in secure coding which in turn would augment secure software development. We propose to build a learner-friendly intelligent tutoring system (ITS) based on the newly discovered security patterns and rules explored. We present our proposed model based on association rule mining in secure software development with the goal of building this ITS. Our proposed model and prototype experiments are discussed in this paper along with challenges and ongoing work.",,,

Limited access to nutritional information at the point of purchase complicates informed dietary choices. This study describes three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to automatically classify and provide nutritional data for campus meals. The approaches use deep learning neural networks for object recognition that are trained using a custom-built dataset. Specifically, three approaches were implemented and evaluated: (1) object detection with Robofiow/YOLO v8, (2) image classification using MobileNetV2, and (3) Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-based menu text analysis. The methods were quantitatively evaluated using information available from public nutrition information sources for university campus restaurants. Our evaluation shows that these systems are able to categorize meals into healthy, moderately healthy, and unhealthy, and can provide comprehensive nutrition metrics.

A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Model for Predicting the Strength of Foam-Cemented Paste Backfill,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9086477/,"Foam-cemented paste backfill (FCPB) has become a trend to solve the problem of roof-contacted filling. In order to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive disadvantages of laboratory uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests, a hybrid artificial intelligence model which combines random forest (RF) algorithm and grid search optimizer (GSO) was proposed for FCPB strength prediction. Moreover, the effects of foaming agent on cement hydration and pore structure characteristics were studied. The results showed that GSO can effectively tune the hyper-parameters of the proposed GSO-RF model and the developed model is an efficient and accurate tool to predict the UCS for FCPB. Though the foaming agent will not change the influence trend of cement-tailings ratio, solid content and curing time, the influence degree will be weakened by the foaming agent. The ranking of the relative importance of influencing variables is: cement-tailings ratio > curing time > foaming agent dosage > solid content. In addition, the foaming agent has no significant effect on the hydration of cement. The foaming agent mainly changes the strength by changing the pore structure characteristics (especially the large pore volume). This research can provided some guidance for developing UCS prediction model for FCPB.",,,

At the near-real-time RIC, xApps access RAN nodes through the E2 interface and offer the option to host traditional algorithms or data-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to control and optimize RAN functionalities. The O-RAN specifications suggest that Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training should not be done on production RAN deployments to avoid network disruptions and degradation in the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the User Equipments (UEs), suggesting the adoption of offline reinforcement learning. However, this approach limits the exploration phase during training to the static data that has already been collected, potentially affecting the performance of the model and its generalization capabilities. Therefore, a safe environment capable of supporting online reinforcement learning is needed to overcome such constraints and to allow AI agents to perform state explorations freely.

Teacher–Student Uncertainty Autoencoder for the Process-Relevant and Quality-Relevant Fault Detection in the Industrial Process,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9802717/,"Fault detection plays an important role in process monitoring, while current fault detection methods only concentrate on process-relevant or quality-relevant faults. Therefore, in this article, a fault detection method based on the improved teacher–student network is proposed, in which both the process-relevant and quality-relevant faults are monitored. Concretely, the student network extracts representation features and the teacher network detects faults. As the features difference between the teacher and student networks can cause performance degradation when the features of teacher network are replaced by the one from student network, representation evaluation block (REB) is proposed to evaluate and reduce the features difference. As a concrete method of REB, uncertainty modeling is proposed to quantify the features difference and alleviate the aleatoric uncertainty, modeling features difference as a central isotropic Gaussian distribution. Then, asynchronous iterative is designed to implement teacher network and student network joint training. Accordingly, REB based on uncertainty modeling is applied in the teacher–student network named as teacher–student uncertainty autoencoder (TSUAE). Finally, a fault detection framework based on TSUAE is proposed, the effectiveness of which is verified in a wastewater treatment process.",,,
Approximate Ontology Reasoning for Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph based on Deep Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9619694/,"Ontology reasoning has great potential in application of domain-specific knowledge graph. However, the traditional ontology reasoner is difficult to perform rapidly reasoning on domain-specific knowledge graph as its complex logical expression and large-scale assertion set. On the other hand, the knowledge graph reasoning method based on presentation learning has better scalability, but it is hard to incorporate expert knowledge in the schema-level information effectively, so it can't implement complex reasoning. The above restricts the application of reasoning in domain-specific knowledge graph. In order to solve the problem, researchers try to combine ontology reasoning with deep learning to achieve approximate ontology reasoning. However, the state-of-the-art method has shortcomings of model design and evaluation which make it lose generalization ability.

A Data-Driven Approach for the Identification of Features for Automated Feedback on Academic Essays,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268328/,"For predicting and improving the quality of essays, text analytic metrics (surface, syntactic, morphological, and semantic features) can be used to provide formative feedback to the students in higher education. In this study, the goal was to identify a sufficient number of features that exhibit a fair proxy of the scores given by the human raters via a data-driven approach. Using an existing corpus and a text analysis tool for the Dutch language, a large number of features were extracted. Artificial neural networks, Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, and backward elimination were used to reduce the number of features automatically. Irrelevant features were eliminated based on the inter-rater agreement between predicted and human scores calculated using Cohen's kappa (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\kappa$</tex-math></inline-formula>). The number of features in this study was reduced from 457 to 28 and grouped into different categories. The results reported in this article are an improvement over a similar previous study. First, the inter-rater reliability between the predicted scores and human raters was increased by tweaking the corpus for overfitting for average scores. The resulting maximum value of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\kappa$</tex-math></inline-formula> showed substantial agreement compared to moderate inter-rater reliability in the prior study.

BEEXPERT: Voice-based Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Personal High School Mathematics Tutor,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192932/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots are increasingly used as personal tutors, especially in teaching high school mathematics. However, existing tools often lack conversational depth, neglect critical thinking, and risk providing false information. To address these issues, this paper introduces BEEXPERT, a voice-based chatbot designed to assist high school students in learning trigonometry. Powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, it retrieves accurate, contextually relevant information from an OpenWebMath dataset of 515 trigonometry documents, supporting interactions in English and Indonesian. While the RAG system achieved substantial correctness (72.98%), it struggled with faithfulness (31.91%) and relevance (47.87%) due to hallucinations and context fragmentation. Feedback from preliminary testing and the Godspeed Questionnaire Series (GQS) highlights positive user reception, with 88% for likeability, 80% for perceived intelligence, and 75% for anthropomorphism. Expert validation also confirmed alignment with the school curriculum. Suggestions for improvement, such as refined prompts and enhanced features, have been partially implemented, with future updates planned to optimize the system further. In essence, BEEXPERT demonstrates significant potential as a personalized learning tool while highlighting areas for improvement to ensure a more robust and effective educational experience.",,,

User-Centric Online Gossip Training for Autoencoder-Based CSI Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9737435/,"Recently, the autoencoder framework has shown great potential in reducing the feedback overhead of the downlink channel state information (CSI). In this work, we further find that the user equipment in practical systems occasionally moves in a relatively stable area for a long time, and the corresponding communication environment is relatively stable. A user-centric online training strategy is proposed to further improve CSI feedback performance using the above characteristics. The key idea of the proposed method is to train a new encoder for a specific area without changes to the decoder at the base station. Given that the CSI training samples are insufficient, two data augmentation strategies, including random erasing and random phase shift, are introduced to improve the neural network generalization. In addition, the proposed user-centric online training framework is extended to the multi-user scenario for considerable performance improvement via gossip learning, which is a fully decentralized distributed learning framework and can use crowd intelligence. The simulation results show that the proposed user-centric online gossip training offers a more substantial increase in the feedback accuracy and can considerably improve autoencoder generalization.",,,
A feedback control optimizer for online and hardware-aware training of Spiking Neural Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11065428/,"Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), biological neuronal networks solve complex cognitive tasks with sparse neuronal activity, recurrent connections, and local learning rules. These mechanisms serve as design principles in Neuromorphic computing, which addresses the critical challenge of energy consumption in modern computing. However, most mixed-signal neuromorphic devices rely on semi- or unsupervised learning rules, which are ineffective for optimizing hardware in supervised learning tasks. This lack of scalable solutions for on-chip learning restricts the potential of mixed-signal devices to enable sustainable, intelligent edge systems. To address these challenges, we present a novel learning algorithm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal devices that integrates spike-based weight updates with feedback control signals. In our framework, a spiking controller generates feedback signals to guide SNN activity and drive weight updates, enabling scalable and local on-chip learning. We first evaluate the algorithm on various classification tasks, demonstrating that single-layer SNNs trained with feedback control achieve performance comparable to artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then assess its implementation on mixed-signal neuromorphic devices by testing network performance in continuous online learning scenarios and evaluating resilience to hyperparameter mismatches. Our results show that the feedback control optimizer is compatible with neuromorphic applications, advancing the potential for scalable, on-chip learning solutions in edge applications.",,,

However, this problem space spans enormous variations in both videos and questions. We discuss methods for creating and characterizing social VQA datasets, including 1) crowdsourcing versus in-house authoring, including sample comparisons of two new datasets that we created (TinySocial-Crowd and TinySocial-InHouse) and the previously existing Social-IQ dataset; 2) a new rubric for characterizing the difficulty and content of a given video; and 3) a new rubric for characterizing question types.

Look Closer to Your Enemy: Learning to Attack via Teacher-Student Mimicking,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955459/,"Deep neural networks have significantly advanced person re-identification (ReID) applications in the realm of the industrial internet, yet they remain vulnerable. Thus, it is crucial to study the robustness of ReID systems, as there are risks of adversaries using these vulnerabilities to compromise industrial surveillance systems. Current adversarial methods focus on generating attack samples using misclassification feedback from victim models (VMs), neglecting VM's cognitive processes. We seek to address this by producing authentic ReID attack instances through VM cognition decryption. This approach boasts advantages like better transferability to open-set ReID tests, easier VM misdirection, and enhanced creation of realistic and undetectable assault images. However, the task of deciphering the cognitive mechanism in VM is widely considered to be a formidable challenge.

Further, benefiting from the multiple opposing task framework of LCYE, we investigate the interpretability and generalization of ReID models from the view of the adversarial attack, including cross-domain adaption, cross-model consensus, and online learning process.

Facial Emotion Analysis for Evaluating the Suitability of Online Learning Modules: A Case Study on a MERN-Based Platform,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10778454/,"Learning is a process that involves the progressive transfer of knowledge, encompassing both the physical and psychological components of the learner. Emotions play a crucial role in the success of learning, yet they are often overlooked in the context of online education. Facial emotion detection technology and emotion analysis offer a solution for effectively recognizing and accommodating students' emotions in digital learning environments. The use of a Learning Management System (LMS) based on the MERN architecture (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is also critical in supporting the flexibility and responsiveness of online learning platforms. This research employed the Agile model, which was systematically planned and organized. The Agile model is an approach that allows for continuous adjustments during development. The aim of this study is to integrate artificial intelligence into an e-learning system to detect and evaluate students’ emotions, thereby enabling the development of more effective online learning methods. The design process following the Agile Method involved needs analysis, modeling with UML (Use Case, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram, and Class Diagram), as well as database and code implementation. The backend development focused on database management, server configuration, and API integration, while the frontend was designed for a responsive user interface. Testing was conducted using Black Box and White Box methods, which demonstrated 100% validity for system functionality, while user feedback through UAT yielded a 94% validity score.

Shared Autonomy for Proximal Teaching,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973807/,"Motor skills education often requires experienced professionals who can provide personalized instruction. Unfortu-nately, the availability of high-quality training can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing. Several recent works have proposed AI -assistance for motor skills instruction, ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However, these works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process, and fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different individuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired by the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared autonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid with curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior improves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight which sub-skills might be most “learnable” for the student, or within their Zone of Proximal Development. We use this to design Z-COACH, a method for using shared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable task sub-skills.

Changeable Rate and Novel Quantization for CSI Feedback Based on Deep Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9799802/,"Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback improves the capacity and energy efficiency of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in frequency division duplexing mode. However, multiple neural networks with different lengths of feedback overhead are required by time-varying bandwidth resources. The storage space required at the user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) for these models increases linearly with the number of models. In this paper, we propose a DL-based changeable-rate framework with novel quantization scheme to improve the efficiency and feasibility of CSI feedback systems. This framework can reutilize all the network layers to achieve overhead-changeable CSI feedback to optimize the storage efficiency at the UE and the BS sides. Designed quantizer in this framework can avoid the normalization and gradient problems faced by traditional quantization schemes. Specifically, we propose two DL-based changeable-rate CSI feedback networks CH- CsiNetPro and CH- DualNetSph by introducing a feedback overhead control unit. Then, a pluggable quantization block (PQB) is developed to further improve the encoding efficiency of CSI feedback in an end-to-end way.

A Joint Learning Framework for Bridging Defect Prediction and Interpretation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095857/,"Understanding why defect predictors classify software components as defective or clean is essential for software engineers that helps identify the root causes of defects and develop actionable bug-fixing plans. Existing solutions employ various explainable artificial intelligence methods to clarify the decision-making processes of defect predictors. However, these post hoc explanation techniques have two main limitations: first, the interpretation results do not accurately reflect the model’s decision logic, and second, they do not contribute to improving the performance of defect predictors. To address these limitations, we treat defect prediction and its corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks, proposing a joint learning framework that trains the predictor and its interpreter simultaneously. The novelty of our approach lies in two main aspects: first, we design a feedback loop that transfers decision logic from the predictor to the interpreter, ensuring a high degree of conciseness for both components. Second, we incorporate interpretation results as a penalty term in the loss function of the joint learning framework. This not only enhances the accuracy of the predictor but also proposes a stronger constraint on the reliability of the interpreter. We validate our method against several existing explainable software defect predictors across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.",,,

Agent-Based Personalized Assessment Tasks Recommendation Considering Objective and Subjective Factors,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108978/,"In traditional education, there is not much difference between assessment tasks designed for learners. However, learners’ learning performance may vary due to a number of factors, e.g., learning ability, academic emotion, and learners’ and teachers’ academic expectations. Considering those factors, accurately recommending personalized assessment tasks for each learner is challenging. To overcome the limitations in the current work, this paper proposed an autonomous-agent-based approach to recommend personalized assessment tasks considering multiple factors. Contributions of the proposed approach contain three aspects: (1) Considering objective factors, the proposed approach involves dynamically adjusting the assessment tasks recommended for students by applying both item response theory and the proposed academic emotion influence model. (2) Considering subjective factors, the proposed approach can dynamically predict learners’ learning performances by applying autonomous agent-based negotiation. (3) The proposed recommendation algorithm based on discrete linear programming can effectively address the issue of cold start in typical recommendation algorithms. The experiments conducted in this paper demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively recommends assessment tasks for learners by considering both objective and subjective factors. The results indicate that this approach generates better recommendation outcomes than traditional content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms. Furthermore, the experiments reveal that the teacher’s personality is the primary factor affecting the recommendation results, while the degree of similarity between the teacher’s and learner’s personality also plays a role.",,,

The existing suggestions are however limited in how comprehensively they can assess students’ production skills based on the taught syllabus. There are some endeavours in the area of automated essay scoring, automated short answer grading or similar methods which would provide feedback without necessarily providing a grade. In terms, of rapid in class feedback of open ended questions there aren’t many helpful solution for the population we want to help. More suggestions which focus on the people either evaluating or being evaluated is necessary. Given the pressures of teaching at scale, how can human-centered technology aid in the development of comprehensive evaluation methods? In this paper, we suggest and implement a method to conduct qualitative evaluations for large scale settings in the context of undergraduate education. To do this, we use word vectors to visualize what students think in response to a prompt.",,,
An Unsupervised Ensemble Clustering Approach for the Analysis of Student Behavioral Patterns,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9314136/,"Specialized services and management must understand students' behavioral patterns in a timely and accurate manner. Based on these patterns, we can make targeted rules, especially for unexpected patterns. To perform this type of work, a questionnaire method is usually used to collect data and analyze students' behavioral states. However, the effectiveness of this method is greatly influenced by the timeliness and validity of the feedback data. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised ensemble clustering framework to use student behavioral data to discover behavioral patterns. Because the behavioral data produced by students on campus are available in real time without intentional bias, clustering analysis can be relatively efficient and reliable. The proposed framework extracts behavior features from the two perspectives of statistics and entropy and then combines density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and k-means algorithms to discover behavioral patterns. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we carry out experiments on six types of behavioral data produced by undergraduates in a university in Beijing and analyze the relationships between different behavioral patterns and students' grade point averages (GPAs). The results show that the framework can not only detect anomalous behavioral patterns but also find mainstream patterns. The findings from this research can assist student-related departments in providing better services and management, such as psychological consulting and academic guidance.",,,

"Integrating VR, AR, and Haptics in Basic Surgical Skills Training: A Review and Perspective",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016012/,"Traditional surgical training faces challenges related to sustainability, cost, and ethical considerations. Limited access to resources, ethical concerns about cadaver-based learning, limited availability of surgical cases, and the high costs associated with hands-on training impede the effectiveness and accessibility of surgical education. Despite these challenges, the need for direct tactile experience remains critical, as it fosters the development of essential motor skills and tactile abilities vital for surgical practice. However, advancements in immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and haptics offer a promising solution to address these challenges. VR and AR technologies offer realistic, controlled environments where learners can visualise anatomical structures and practice surgical procedures without risks. The integration of haptic feedback in these immersive simulations further enriches the learning process by adding the sense of touch and physical interaction, aiding in mastering critical surgical skills. The incorporation of immersive technologies in surgical training presents an opportunity to address the constraints of conventional methods. These technologies offer the possibility of creating platforms that replicate real-life surgical scenarios, allowing learners to hone their skills and build confidence in a safe and controlled environment. Moreover, immersive learning offers an ethical alternative to cadaver-based training and extends access to training materials irrespective of geographical limitations. Such an approach allows for step-based training, where students may begin acquiring skills through immersive learning, then move to special surgical simulators, and finally to patients. This article deals with the impact of immersive technologies such as VR, AR, and haptics on reshaping conventional surgical training, by focusing specifically on basic surgical skills.

Transferring Virtual Surgical Skills to Reality: AI Agents Mastering Surgical Decision-Making in Vascular Interventional Robotics,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598392/,"Vascular interventional surgery offers advantages, such as minimal invasiveness, quick recovery, and low side-effects. Performing automatic guidewire navigation on vascular surgical robots can effectively assist doctors in performing surgery.

Relative Distributed Formation and Obstacle Avoidance with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9812263/,"Multi-agent formation as well as obstacle avoid-ance is one of the most actively studied topics in the field of multi-agent systems. Although some classic controllers like model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy control achieve a certain measure of success, most of them require precise global information which is not accessible in harsh environments. On the other hand, some reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches adopt the leader-follower structure to organize different agents' behaviors, which sacrifices the collaboration between agents thus suffering from bottlenecks in maneuver-ability and robustness. In this paper, we propose a distributed formation and obstacle avoidance method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Agents in our system only utilize local and relative information to make decisions and control themselves distributively, and will reorganize themselves into a new topology quickly in case that any of them is dis-connected. Our method achieves better performance regarding formation error, formation convergence rate and on-par success rate of obstacle avoidance compared with baselines (both classic control methods and another RL-based method). The feasibility of our method is verified by both simulation and hardware implementation with Ackermann-steering vehicles.",,,
Determinants of Using AI-Based Chatbots for Knowledge Sharing: Evidence From PLS-SEM and Fuzzy Sets (fsQCA),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10033095/,"While adopting chatbots powered by artificial intelligence could enhance knowledge sharing, it also causes challenges due to the “dark side” of these agents. However, research on the factors influencing chatbots for knowledge sharing is lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed the integrated chatbot acceptance-avoidance model, which looks at the positive and negative determinants of using chatbots for knowledge sharing. Through a comprehensive questionnaire survey of 447 students, the research model is evaluated using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a symmetric approach, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) as an asymmetric approach. The PLS-SEM results supported the positive role of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and habit and the negative role of perceived threats in affecting chatbot use for knowledge sharing. Although PLS-SEM results revealed that social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation have no impact on chatbot use, the fsQCA analysis revealed that all factors might play a role in shaping the use of chatbots.

Anomaly detection in Internet of Things using feature selection and classification based on Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network on N-BaIoT dataset,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9469605/,"According to the paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT), physical devices are connected to each other and to the Internet such that they operate automatically. One of the major challenges in the IoT is to detect and prevent intruders into the network and devices, a challenge that traditional solutions of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are not responsive for it or at least not very efficient to use in IoT. In this article, we address the problem of using machine learning methods for anomaly detection and two methods for feature extraction and classification are proposed. The first method is feature extraction and classification using Logistic Regression (LR) and the second method is to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the N_BaIoT dataset, which consists of data samples related to nine devices IoT and several attacks is used according to a number of criteria for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

Cloud Mining Pool Aided Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Things: An Evolutionary Game Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9531057/,"The past few years have witnessed an exponential growth of diverse Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as compelling applications ranging from industrial production to medical care. Dramatic advances in IoT technology not only brought enormous economic opportunities but also challenges (e.g., privacy and security vulnerabilities). Recently, with the appearance of blockchain technology, the integration of IoT and blockchain (BCoT) is considered a promising solution to address these issues. Blockchain provides a secure and scalable data management framework for IoT devices. However, the huge computation and energy cost of the consensus process in blockchain prevents it from being directly applied as a generic platform. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose a cloud mining pool-aided BCoT architecture, where the IoT devices can rent the computing resources from the cloud mining pools to offload the mining process. Based on this architecture, we study the mining pool selection problem and analyze the colony behaviors of IoT devices with different pooling strategies. We propose a centralized evolutionary game-based pool selection algorithm for the sake of maximizing the system utility. Considering the non-cooperative relationship among multiple miners, we also propose a lightweight distributed reinforcement learning algorithm, named the ‘WoLF-PHC’ algorithm.",,,
A Journey Through Cyberium: Creating User Stories for a Dystopic World to Teach Requirements Engineering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024349/,"Teaching Requirements Engineering (RE) is challenging, as it involves dealing with the complexity and abstraction of technical and business problems. Students need to learn how to properly identify requirements, document them, validate them, and communicate with various stakeholders, such as clients and technical teams, to understand what needs to be done. Traditional teaching methods often fail to engage students, making bridging theoretical concepts with practical applications difficult. This paper presents the Game Design Storytelling (GDS) process as a framework to gamify educational experiences in RE. GDS integrates narrative-based game elements with learning objectives, offering a structured approach to create interactive and engaging lessons. We applied GDS in an RE class focused on creating user stories using a dystopian narrative set in a fictional world called “Cyberium.” Students were challenged to solve complex problems by developing user stories within this immersive environment. The results indicate that the gamified lesson increased student engagement and facilitated the understanding of technical concepts.

This includes access to the library services, information about their courses, and academic-related materials. On the other hand, this progress is not without its problems, as most of these services have a finite lifespan while the team still supports them. The student portal should build an artificial intelligence (AI) agent, like a chatbot, to provide 24/7 support for its users. This Chatbot must have a straight-forward user interface or GUI with excellent efficiency; hence it must be a simple system that users with minimal technical understanding can operate. It is intended that by acting as a customer support representative, a chatbot can enhance the user experience on student portal. This paper presents the findings from systematic literature review on previous works of intelligent chatbot implementation in student portal.

ReliCD: A Reliable Cognitive Diagnosis Framework with Confidence Awareness,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415839/,"During the past few decades, cognitive diagnostics modeling has attracted increasing attention in computational education communities, which is capable of quantifying the learning status and knowledge mastery levels of students. Indeed, the recent advances in neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of traditional cognitive diagnosis models through learning the deep representations of students and exercises. Nevertheless, existing approaches often suffer from the issue of overconfidence in predicting students’ mastery levels, which is primarily caused by the unavoidable noise and sparsity in realistic student-exercise interaction data, severely hindering the educational application of diagnostic feedback. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel Reliable Cognitive Diagnosis (ReliCD) framework, which can quantify the confidence of the diagnosis feedback and is flexible for different cognitive diagnostic functions. Specifically, we first propose a Bayesian method to explicitly estimate the state uncertainty of different knowledge concepts for students, which enables the confidence quantification of diagnostic feedback. In particular, to account for potential differences, we suggest modeling individual prior distributions for the latent variables of different ability concepts using a pre-trained model. Additionally, we introduce a logical hypothesis for ranking confidence levels. Along this line, we design a novel calibration loss to optimize the confidence parameters by modeling the process of student performance prediction. Finally, extensive experiments on four real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our ReliCD framework.",,,

The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future.

"eVision: Influenza Forecasting Using CDC, WHO, and Google Trends Data",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311072/,"Influenza, more commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses which in the 2018–19 flu season, infected 37.4 to 42.9 million people in the United States alone. Of those, 431 to 647 thousand were hospitalized and 36,400 to 61,200 (most of them elderly and children) succumbed to the disease. At the time of this writing, the best known defense against influenza is vaccination. However, due to the annual mutation of the very many strands of the flu virus, new vaccines must be administered every flu season. Hence, the prediction of the rate of growth in reported infection cases of each strand of the flu is paramount to ensuring the correct supply of vaccines per strand. Machine learning - specifically Neural Networks - are a great tool for making future predictions using existing data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are utilized by Santa Clara University's EPIC (Ethical, Pragmatic, and Intelligent Computing) and BioInnovation & Design laboratories for continued research and development of a tool named eVision (Epidemic Vision) to predict the trend of influenza cases throughout the flu season. eVision has been trained on data gathered across 4 flu seasons from the 2014–15 season to the 2017–18 season of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) records as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Google Trends search result data gathered across the same period of time. eVision has been able to make 7 weeks in advance predictions about the flu trend in the 2018–19 United States flu season with 90.15% accuracy.

TAKDSR: Teacher Assistant Knowledge Distillation Framework for Graphics Image Super-Resolution,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10281362/,"This paper presents a framework for effectively applying knowledge distillation (KD) to super-resolution (SR) tasks for computer graphics (CG) images. Specifically, we propose TAKDSR, a KD framework for SR using a teacher assistant (TA) network. Recently, the performance of SR models has improved dramatically thanks to the development of deep learning. SR models have evolved into a form that requires a considerable amount of computation and parameters while adopting a complex neural network structure to improve performance. However, it is difficult to utilize conventional high-performance SR models for real-time up-scaling in CG applications requiring high resolution and high frame rate. To solve this, we employ an approach that applies KD to a lightweight SR model. At this time, if the high-resolution (HR) image is used as input for the teacher to show superior performance to the student, a large performance difference occurs between the two due to the excessive performance of the teacher. As a result, the teacher’s knowledge has a significantly hard and complex nature, and when transferred to the student, the effect of KD can be rather weakened. Therefore, we adopt a TA network to facilitate the propagation of knowledge between teacher and student. At the same time, the distribution of compact features (CF), which are the decoder input of the teacher, is discretized so that it is compatible with the input distribution of the student, enabling effective KD. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed TAKDSR significantly improves the performance of a given SR model on CG image datasets.",,,
SENSE: a Student Performance Quantifier using Sentiment Analysis,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207721/,"Academic feedback is essential in secondary schools to keep a rapport between students, teachers, and parents and guardians. There are three main factors that contribute towards a student's progress: attitude, attendance and aptitude. Monitoring their progress is key to a student's development in school and allows both teachers and parents or guardians to support them to a greater extent. Annual reports are sent to a student's home to summarise their performance over the academic year, following set criterion from the government. One aspect of a student's report is the teacher's written comment, providing more details on a student's attitude towards their learning. However, families whose primary language is not English may struggle to interpret this information. Working in schools has demonstrated the diversity of students and their wide range of backgrounds, including - but not limited to - language barriers. This work proposes a system called SENSE (Student pErformance quaNtifier using SEntiment analysis) for improving the information conveyed in secondary school reports through means of natural language processing. By combining the three key features which contribute towards a student's progress, a numerical representation is produced for an easier interpretation. This reduces the likelihood of a tarnished relationship between home and schools through better means of conveying information and maintains communication between students, teachers and parents or guardians.",,,

Six 2nd grade students participated in the pilot study. A Filipino teacher conducted three sets of ORF assessments in order to monitor the students' progress in their ORF. The multidimensional fluency scale by Rasinski was used for ORF scoring. Results show that with the use of ART-Fil, students have accelerated their learning as evidenced by their ORF scores, reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension. Bottom performers obtained greater improvements in their ORF as compared with those of the more fluent readers going into the program. Readability level of the text also affected the children's reading performance. Some students who used ART-Fil also adopted the proper prosody such as expression and phrasing. Adjustments in the ART-Fil's navigation and interface design were made in order to accommodate various behaviors of children. Survey results show that teachers and parents believed that the ART-Fil is useful and effective. Future work includes investigating both ASR-based and ASR-free methods for automating the ORF assessment process.",,,
Enhanced Federated Reinforcement Learning for Mobility-Aware Node Selection and Model Compression,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437681/,"Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning architecture that allows multiple agents to share knowledge in machine learning. However, in the scenario with mobile agents, the mobility of agents significantly affects the learning performance. Besides, frequent exchange of local models could result in high communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a Mobility-aware Federated Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) framework. In MFRL, we model the influences of agent mobility on communication quality and data correlation, and devise a mobility-aware node selection algorithm, so as to accelerate the training procedure and improve the learning performance, taking learning quality, wireless channel quality, and data correlation of agents into consideration. A knowledge distillation (KD) based model compression method is integrated into the MFRL to reduce the communication overhead as well as accelerate the inference process. Finally, taking deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based collision avoidance of intelligent vehicles as a study case, the effectiveness of MFRL is verified. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MFRL can accelerate the training process and improve the learning performance.",,,

A Flipped Remote Lab: Using a Peer-Assessment Tool for Learning 3-D Modeling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415237/,"This article introduces a novel approach to remote laboratory instruction, specifically designed for teaching three-dimensional modeling using Blender software. The lab uses virtual machines to provide students with the necessary computational power to carry out the course activities, along with the correct version of the software. The flipped remote lab approach combines the elements of flipped classroom and peer assessment, making it suitable for face-to-face, totally online, or hybrid classes. Prior to each of the two lectures, students begin to practice by replicating the instructor's demonstrations in a set of concise tutorials. Upon completion of the assigned tasks, students carry out self-assessments of their own modeling, in addition to assessing two models created by their peers. A rubric comprising three questions facilitates the assessment process and allows providing feedback on each response. During the subsequent lecture, students work together with the instructor to address challenges encountered in their modeling, exploring also the advanced aspects of software usage that time constraints preclude in a traditional setting. The analysis of the flipped remote lab results reveals that student responses in peer-assessment activities are relevant to the posed questions. Moreover, the students who realized the models demonstrated a comparable level of rigor in self-assessment as their mates who reviewed their works. While students express a high degree of appreciation for the laboratory activities, a notable concern is the highlighted heavy workload. Increasing the allocated time for task completion can help mitigate the workload impact. The article concludes with insights gained from the implementation of the flipped remote lab approach.",,,
Advanced Emotion Analytics of Virtual Group Meetings involving Intelligent Virtual Agents,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9757527/,"In this paper, we present our first prototype of a virtual group meeting emotion analytics tool based on both real human participants and virtual agents.

Toward an AIoT-Based Body Sensor Network for Learning Tai-Chi Chun,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119760/,"Tai Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art, is known for its benefits in promoting physical and mental well-being, such as slowing aging, preventing diseases, and alleviating stress. However, learning Tai Chi can be challenging, especially for beginners without an instructor’s guidance. Mastery requires understanding complex principles like body coordination, weight shifting, and force exertion, which are essential for proper technique. Traditional training relies heavily on experienced instructors, making it difficult for individuals to practice independently and progress effectively. This study addresses the challenge faced by beginners who struggle to improve without continuous feedback, particularly in the absence of an instructor. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system to guide and correct students’ movements using wearable sensors, including inertial measurement units (IMUs) and smart insoles, along with smartphone cameras. The system collects motion data from both instructors and students, compares their movements, and provides immediate feedback on discrepancies. Unlike other Tai-Chi training systems that focus mainly on posture correction, our system emphasizes force exertion—a key component of Tai Chi. By analyzing movements and weight distribution, the system helps students identify errors in technique, improving their force generation and body coordination. This feedback mechanism enables independent practice, making Tai-Chi training more accessible and efficient.",,,
Search to Distill: Pearls Are Everywhere but Not the Eyes,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156803/,"Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) approaches distill the knowledge of a cumbersome teacher model into the parameters of a student model with a pre-defined architecture. However, the knowledge of a neural network, which is represented by the network's output distribution conditioned on its input, depends not only on its parameters but also on its architecture. Hence, a more generalized approach for KD is to distill the teacher's knowledge into both the parameters and architecture of the student. To achieve this, we present a new \textit{Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation (AKD)} approach that finds student models (pearls for the teacher) that are best for distilling the given teacher model. In particular, we leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS), equipped with our KD-guided reward, to search for the best student architectures for a given teacher. Experimental results show our proposed AKD consistently outperforms the conventional NAS plus KD approach, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task under various latency settings. Furthermore, the best AKD student architecture for the ImageNet classification task also transfers well to other tasks such as million level face recognition and ensemble learning.",,,

Mobile Computing for Language Testing in Blended Learning Environments: Combining Traditional and Digital Assessment Tools,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081329/,"This paper presents a novel approach to language testing by integrating mobile computing, gamification, and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) into a unified platform for blended learning environments. The framework combines traditional assessments, such as essays and oral exams, with gamified digital tools like points, badges, levels, and leaderboards, creating an engaging, adaptive learning experience. BERT enhances task creation by generating contextually appropriate questions tailored to individual proficiency levels, ensuring that learners remain challenged without feeling overwhelmed. It evaluates structured and open-ended responses through advanced semantic and grammatical analysis, providing detailed feedback that highlights strengths and areas for improvement. Gamified elements, including storylines and challenges, immerse learners in real-world language scenarios, such as acting as a diplomat in cross-cultural communication tasks.

Robotic Peg-in-Hole Insertion with Tight Clearances: A Force-based Deep Q-Learning Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460031/,"The automatic execution of contact-rich assembly tasks such as peg-in-hole insertion still remains a challenge in industrial manufacturing automation. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn complex robotic skills, but requires extensive data collection and relatively long execution times when trained online on the physical hardware. In this paper, a robotic setup and RL implementation are presented, which can learn how to successfully perform the peg-in-hole insertion task.

Evaluation Singing Art Voice Quality Using Siamese Gated Recurrent Extreme Learning Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168495/,"The quick evolution of artificial intelligence and deep learning has provided new chances for singing art voice quality assessment, where exact evaluation of the vocal performance is critical to training, music education, and intelligent feedback systems. Current methods tend to depend on hand-engineered acoustic features, rule-based processing, or shallow machine learning models that do not handle intricate temporal-spectral dependencies present in singing signals and exhibit weak generalization and weak adaptability to varied voice types. Conventional methods like MFCC-based classification, simple CNN architectures, and recurrent networks have demonstrated some progress but are faced with high computation, overfitting, and inadequate robust attention mechanisms. To cope with the above challenges, a Siamese Gated Recurrent Extreme Learning Networks (SGRELN) is proposed by incorporating gated recurrent units, extreme learning machines and Siamese modules for emphasizing prominent vocal features. Experimental results clearly show noteworthy superiority, where RAT-CNN attains 98.8% accuracy and 97.7 % F1-score compared to traditional models.

Engagement Prediction Method Based on Spatiotemporal Facial Feature Redistribution,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10730531/,"Automated detection of learners' engagement levels enhances online teaching by enabling timely feedback and personalized adjustments based on student needs, thereby improving teaching effectiveness. Traditional methods rely heavily on single-frame facial spatial data, often neglecting temporal emotional and behavioral features and being sensitive to pose variations. Additionally, convolutional padding can degrade feature maps, impacting feature extraction quality. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Facial Feature Redistribution and Temporal Convolutional Network (SFRNet). This hybrid neural network architecture incorporates three key components: utilizing the spatial attention mechanism LKA to capture local patches and mitigate pose effects, employing the FOWD module to redistribute feature weights, eliminate irrelevant features, and enhance facial representation, and analyzing temporal changes using the ModernTCN module to detect engagement levels. We curated a near-infrared engagement video dataset (NEVD) to validate SFRNet's efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in engagement video analysis on both NEVD and publicly available DAiSEE datasets through extensive experimentation and comprehensive studies.",,,
Curriculum Dataset Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063689/,"Most dataset distillation methods struggle to accommodate large-scale datasets due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Recent research has begun to explore scalable disentanglement methods. However, there are still performance bottlenecks and room for optimization in this direction. In this paper, we present a curriculum-based dataset distillation framework aiming to harmonize performance and scalability. This framework strategically distills synthetic images, adhering to a curriculum that transitions from simple to complex. By incorporating curriculum evaluation, we address the issue of previous methods generating images that tend to be homogeneous and simplistic, doing so at a manageable computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce adversarial optimization towards synthetic images to further improve their representativeness and safeguard against their overfitting to the neural network involved in distilling. This enhances the generalization capability of the distilled images across various neural network architectures and also increases their robustness to noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework sets new benchmarks in large-scale dataset distillation, achieving substantial improvements of 11.1% on Tiny-ImageNet, 9.0% on ImageNet-1K, and 7.3% on ImageNet-21K.

Automatic Context-Aware Inference of Engagement in HMI: A Survey,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136823/,"Engagement is the process by which participants establish, maintain, and end their perceived connection. Automatic engagement inference is one of the tasks required to develop successful human-centered HMI applications. Engagement is a multi-faceted multimodal construct requiring high accuracy in interpretating contextual, verbal and non-verbal cues, making the development of an intelligent automated engagement inference system challenging. Existing surveys concentrate on specific application settings, and a comprehensive survey covering the different engagement facets, definition and inference across various contexts is lacking. Moreover, despite the importance of context-aware modeling, the literature lacks a systematic context-aware overview on the topic. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on previous work in engagement for HMI, entailing interdisciplinary definition, engagement components, publicly available datasets, ground truth assessment, and commonly used features and methods, serving as a guide for the development of future HMI interfaces with reliable context-aware engagement inference capability. An in-depth review across embodied and disembodied interaction modes, and an emphasis on the interaction context of which engagement is studied sets apart this survey from existing ones.

With the continuous development of intelligent information service applications, knowledge graphs have been widely used in question-answering, semantic search, recommender system, language understanding, and advanced analysis, etc. Knowledge graph construction process includes knowledge representation, knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion and knowledge reasoning. However, in the research of knowledge graphs, there are still some challenges. For example, knowledge representation methods require prior knowledge and manually defined rules. In knowledge extraction, it is difficult to obtain labeled data. Knowledge fusion issues of effectively and efficiently integrating big data and heterogeneous data need to be addressed urgently. The interpretability and reliability of knowledge reasoning need to be further improved. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an effective method for solving sequential decision-making problems.

Toward Better Low-Rate Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback: A Test Channel-Based Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413273/,"Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback provides satisfactory reconstruction accuracy of downlink CSI for the base station in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although the introduction of codeword quantization improves the efficiency and feasibility of DL-based CSI feedback networks, the gradient problem caused by quantizers in the training stage compromises the performance of neural networks. In this paper, by considering the test channel as an equivalent of ideal rate-distortion quantization in a mutual information sense, we propose a test channel-based quantization module (TCQM) for DL-based CSI feedback networks which mitigates the gradient problem in the end-to-end training of CSI feedback networks. Moreover, the training of the CSI feedback network with TCQM is not dependent on the design of practical quantizer in the inference stage, which reduces the complexity of the training and design constraints of the CSI feedback system. Finally, for the setting of fixed feedback overhead, based on the idea of TCQM, we propose an adaptive training strategy for CSI feedback networks to evaluate the proper combination of codeword length and quantization rate of codeword elements to achieve the optimal reconstruction accuracy. Experiment results show that the proposed schemes outperform existing codeword quantization schemes in the literature.",,,
Ideating and Developing a Visualization Dashboard to Support Teachers Using Educational Games in the Classroom,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9446995/,"Technology has become an integral part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. Additionally, video games are one of the most popular mediums across cultures and ages. There is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for learning and assessment, and educators are mainly supportive of using games in classrooms. However, we do not usually find educational games within the classroom activities. One of the main problems is that teachers report difficulties to actually know how their students are using the game so that they can analyze properly the effect of the activity and the interaction of students. To support teachers, educational games should incorporate learning analytics to transform data generated by students when playing useful information in a friendly and understandable way. For this work, we build upon Shadowspect, a 3D geometry puzzle game that has been used by teachers in a group of schools in the US. We use learning analytics techniques to generate a set of metrics implemented in a live dashboard that aims to facilitate that teachers can understand students' interaction with Shadowspect. We depict the multidisciplinary design process that we have followed to generate the metrics and the dashboard with great detail.

Easing the Learning of the Robustness Diagram by Using an Assisted Modeler Tool: An Empirical Study with Ungraduated Students,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066738/,"One of the critical parts of software capstone projects is modeling since students need to learn it to be able to produce largescale and reliable software. UML is considered a de facto standard for software modeling and is widely accepted in education and industry. However, UML is sometimes misused due to discrepancies between different models. Further, most popular modeling tools used in academic environments have numerous weaknesses, including being overly complex, which could result in a cognitive overload. We proposed a hybrid method named Scrumconix as a base to teach software engineering. This method includes the robustness diagram that closes the gap between use case specification and detailed design and code, which is helpful for developers and particularly for students. We also developed a modeler (called Robix) to support and ease the learning of this diagram by applying the diagram rules. We evaluated the Robix modeler with ungraduated students, and we obtained that those who used the Robix modeler during a learning phase had significantly fewer errors in an academic evaluation at applying the diagram rules and using its stereotypes than those who did not use our modeler. Concerning usability and usefulness perception, the Robix modeler had high rates of both factors by the participants. These results encourage us to conduct another study with a larger sample to corroborate the obtained results and corroborate whether the modeler also eases the representation of use case flow in the robustness diagram.",,,

Information as Interpretation: Measuring Learning Behavior for Knowledge Insight,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11052294/,"Traditional Learning Analytics (LA) has been primarily focused on the behavioral aspects of learners’ learning due to its data-driven nature, often lacking analysis of the knowledge-related aspects of what learners have learned. To tackle this issue, the Information Theory on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (ITLAK) framework uses information theory to quantify the informational value of learners’ learning behavior regarding their interaction with knowledge. This paper shows the foundation of ITLAK and its case study, demonstrating its theoretical validity and practical usefulness. ITLAK was applied to the context of English Intensive Reading (IR) specialized in English grammar learning, and a field experiment was conducted with Japanese junior high school third-year students using an IR system. The results showed the possibility that the information content calculated by ITLAK is an indicator that can capture the behavioral and knowledge-related aspects of learning. In particular, it was suggested that the information content metric functions in immediate feedback and captures aspects of learning distinct from the number of contacts with knowledge. However, this case study is limited by the small sample size, reliance on subjective self-assessment, and short intervention period, so further large-scale and long-term studies with objective proficiency measures are needed to validate and generalize the findings. This finding can indicate that ITLAK provides a theoretical foundation for advancing Knowledge-Aware Learning Analytics (KALA) and opens new possibilities for LA. Future research will involve revalidating the findings with large-scale data and designing learning support models.",,,

Lecture Presentations Multimodal Dataset: Towards Understanding Multimodality in Educational Videos,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376585/,"Many educational videos use slide presentations, a sequence of visual pages that contain text and figures accompanied by spoken language, which are constructed and presented carefully in order to optimally transfer knowledge to students. Previous studies in multimedia and psychology attribute the effectiveness of lecture presentations to their multimodal nature. As a step toward developing vision-language models to aid in student learning as intelligent teacher assistants, we introduce the Lecture Presentations Multimodal (LPM) Dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of vision-and-language models in multimodal understanding of educational videos. Our dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer science, dentistry, biology). We introduce three research tasks, (1) figure-to-text retrieval, (2) text-to-figure retrieval, and (3) generation of slide explanations, which are grounded in multimedia learning and psychology principles to test a vision-language model’s understanding of multimodal content. We provide manual annotations to help implement these tasks and establish baselines on them. Comparing baselines and human student performances, we find that state-of-the-art vision-language models (zero-shot and fine-tuned) struggle in (1) weak crossmodal alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums, (3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. We introduce PolyViLT, a novel multimodal transformer trained with a multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches for retrieval.

On a Meta Learning-Based Scheduler for Deep Learning Clusters,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229506/,"Deep learning (DL) has become a dominating type of workloads on AI computing platforms. The performance of such platforms highly depends on how distributed DL jobs are scheduled. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based schedulers have been extensively studied and are capable of modeling interferences between concurrent jobs competing for resources. However, existing RL-based schedulers must learn from large number of samples and adapt to workload changes in real systems, which is a huge cost for production clusters. This paper proposes an intelligent, autonomous scheduler that employs sample-efficient RL for real-world resource scheduling on complex DL clusters. Specifically, we design a closed-loop meta-RL-based worker placement algorithm for DL training jobs. Instead of random exploration, we encourage the scheduler to explore combinatorial subspaces, where the performance model might be inaccurate, to improve the sampling efficiency of the scheduler agent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other baselines in terms of average job completion time with 12.29% to 16.24% improvements.

The Use of Agent-Based Models As Non-Player Characters in Serious Games,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201889/,"One of the shortcomings of many modern serious games and medical simulations lies in their inability to model even some modicum of unpredictability of real life situations. Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.",,,
Classroom Student Behavior Recognition Using an Intelligent Sensing Framework,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10925429/,"Recognizing classroom student behavior is crucial for evaluating teaching quality and fostering effective learning environments. However, existing methods often rely on teachers’ direct observation or intelligent static image analysis, missing important temporal cues that reflect subtle interactive and collaborative processes in the classroom. To address this gap, this study proposes an Intelligent Sensing Framework based on a Multimodal Framework Transformer that integrates video and audio modalities. By capturing temporal features from video streams and leveraging audio signals, our approach accurately identifies nuanced student behaviors, thus overcoming the limitations of single-modality methods. We evaluate our framework on the newly introduced CSBR10 dataset, containing ten categories of student behavior with over 700 clips per category, and further validate its robustness on the UCF-101 dataset. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method improves temporal modeling over traditional image-based baselines and achieves significant accuracy gains when fusing audio and video modalities.

However, in order to enhance their effectiveness and provide a more human-like tutoring experience, robots must be capable of adapting to the user and exhibiting proactivity. By acting proactively, these intelligent robotic tutors can anticipate potential obstacles and take preventative measures to avoid negative outcomes. However, determining when and how to behave proactively remains an open question. This study investigates how a robotic tutor can utilize a student’s cognitive-affective states to trigger proactive tutoring dialogue and improve the learning experience. Specifically, we observed a concept learning task scenario where a robotic assistant proactively assisted the user when negative states, such as frustration and confusion, were detected. In an empirical study involving 40 undergraduate and doctoral students, we evaluated whether the initiation of proactive behavior after the detection of signs of confusion and frustration improves the student’s concentration and trust in the robot. We also examined which level of proactive dialogue is most effective for promoting concentration and trust. The results indicate that high levels of proactive behavior can harm trust, especially when triggered during negative cognitive-affective states. However, this behavior does contribute to keeping the student focused on the task when triggered during these states. Based on our findings, we discuss potential future steps for improving the proactive assistance of robotic tutoring systems.",,,

First, a multilayer AE network with skip connections is proposed to fully extract the abundant latent features from HSIs and enhance the expressive ability of the network. The reconstructed HSI can be obtained by the proposed AE network. Second, to suppress the anomaly targets in the obtained reconstructed HSI and better represent background features, a guided module based on a guided image is added to the network to reduce the feature representation of the anomaly targets by providing feedback information. Moreover, the guided image is calculated using a proposed spectral similarity method that uses the local spatial features of the HSI. Finally, we use the reconstruction error as a performance metric and compare the results of our proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods on six real-world HSIs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",,,

Accelerating Communication for UAV-Enabled Federated Learning With Adaptive Routing and Robust Aggregation Over Edge Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598183/,"Nowadays, manufacturers are beginning to apply artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the enhanced data processing, target recognition, tracking capabilities, etc. Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning technique that can perform these above complicated functions by providing UAVs with powerful learning capabilities. Since, the dynamics of UAVs, parameter aggregation for the UAV-enabled FL is accomplished in the ground edge networks. However, traffic flows of the ground edge network are always changed and unpredictable due to the dynamics of accessed UAVs. It slows down the process of training traffic communication of UAV FL and thus hampers the model knowledge sharing. Things would get worse with a fixed FL central parameter server in the ground edge network when the location of UAVs may change at any time. To address these issues, we investigate the joint optimization problem of FL training traffic steering and dynamic central parameter server selection in the ground edge networks in this study. Specifically, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) routing method to adaptively steer training traffic for the ground edge networks. Then, based on the DRL routing agent, the robust central parameter server selection is performed in the UAV-enabled FL training process. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed method significantly decreases the communication time in UAV-enabled FL training up to 65.9% compared with the benchmark algorithms.",,,

Gamifying Cultural Immersion: Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR) in City Heritage,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938253/,"The exploration of city culture and heritage has gone through a fundamental transition in today's digital world, boosted by the introduction of extended Reality (XR) technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Augmented Reality (AR). These developments have provided new opportunities for individuals to profoundly engage with historical narratives and artistic expressions inherent in urban environments. Despite these technical advancements, a critical research gap remains in properly combining these immersive technologies with gamification principles to improve cultural exploration. This study seeks to fill this gap by studying the integration of gamification into XR settings, with the goal of increasing participant engagement, cooperation, and interaction while digging into the various layers of a city's history and artistic heritage. Two complementary use cases are presented: one centred on VR and the other on MR, both of which provide unique immersive experiences customised to exploring city culture. Gamification ideas are implemented into these use cases, with game elements used to encourage user involvement and participation within historical and artistic settings. Students are actively involved in the development of cultural heritage applications, highlighting the value of educational engagement. To assess the success and validity of this approach, a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire is distributed to users participating in these immersive experiences. The survey findings evaluate user perceptions, satisfaction levels, and the effectiveness of gamification aspects in improving their understanding and connection to the city's heritage. The VR application received a score of 71.77 (out of 100), while the MR application received a score of 65.94 (out of 100), both being very close to the average SUS score of 68. Moreover, to improve the rigour of our evaluation, the User Engagement Scale (UES) is also incorporated. The UES results indicate that participants felt more immersed in the MR application (4.33) compared to the VR application (3.57). This difference may be attributed to the MR application's ability to integrate interactive elements with the real-world environment, enhancing the sense of presence and relevance for users. Both applications had similar perceived usability scores, while the MR app slightly outperformed the VR app in aesthetics and rewarding factors, suggesting a better overall user experience.",,,

Rationalized Sine Cosine Optimization With Efficient Searching Patterns,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9047900/,"Even with the advantages of the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) in solving multimodal problems, there are some shortcomings for this method. We observe that the random patterns utilized in SCA cause an increasing attraction toward local optima. This study developed a rationalized version of this technique to deal with several representative benchmark cases with different dimensions. The improved algorithm combines the chaotic local search mechanism and Lévy flight operator with the core trends of SCA. The new variant is named as CLSCA. The Lévy flight with long jumps is adopted to boost the exploratory tendencies of the algorithm, while the chaotic local search mechanism is used as a local search for the destination point, which helps to further enhance the exploitation capability of SCA. Therefore, a suitable equilibrium between the exploration and exploitation can be kept in the CLSCA by two embedded patterns. To investigate the effectiveness and strength of the developed method, the CLSCA was tested on many benchmark functions, including different types of tasks such as single modal, multi-modal, hybrid, and composition functions. We compare the CLSCA with well-known optimizers, like particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, grey wolf optimizer (GWO), SCA with differential evolution (SCADE), opposition-based SCA (OBSCA), fuzzy self-tuning PSO (FST_PSO), chaotic salp swarm algorithm (CSSA), and Chaotic whale optimizer (CWOA). Numerical experimental results demonstrate that the exploratory and exploitative properties of the classical SCA are clearly improved. The experimental results also show that our improved CLSCA is a better technique for different kinds of optimization tasks.",,,

However, this immense potential, which has ignited widespread research enthusiasm, is critically undermined due to the lack of transparency and interpretability. The automated generation of articulate and comprehensive diagnostic reports will bridge this critical gap by not only illuminate the AI’s diagnostic rational but also substantially reduce the demanding workload of the medical professionals.

In this paper, we propose the Forgetting law guided knowledge tracking model by adversarial training (AFGAKT), which consists of an embedding module fused with forgetting laws, an feature extraction module, a pre- and post-relationship extraction module, and a prediction module. To enhance the model's robustness, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the embedding layer of the model. Finally, we propose a scoring method to provide teaching feedback.

Applying a Psychotherapeutic Theory to the Modeling of Affective Intelligent Agents,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8692640/,"In this paper, we propose the application of a well-known psychotherapeutic model, the Ellis's ABC theory, to the modeling of intelligent agents. The final aim is to be able to simulate human realistic behavior in situations in which varied reactions are possible and are determined by several factors such as personality, affective state, prior experiences, and regulation capabilities. The proposed framework, called ABC-EBDI, is the result of integrating the ABC theory into a BDI framework. Other affective theories have also been taken into account to support the modeling of personality, mood, and affect regulation. The distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is the classification of the agent's cognitive-affective process as either rational or irrational. This process will lead to functional emotions and adaptive conduct, in the first case, and dysfunctional emotions and maladaptive conduct in the second. While the ABC-EBDI framework may be used in different application domains due to its characteristics it can be particularly useful in mental health application.

To achieve overall optimization, we introduce a unified-policy multi-agent framework, where a unified routing strategy across sharing-parameters devices ensures flexibility in diverse networks. Instead of purely DRL-based routing algorithms, we combine traditional methods and DRL algorithms for the robustness of Chimera by introducing the traditional protocol as a policy in Policy Pool and leveraging routing exploration for local observation supplement. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Chimera outperforms rule-based and DRL-based routing algorithms in learning effective routing policies, where Chimera achieves an average of 19% higher throughput, 14% less packet loss, and 22% lower delay compared to the best baseline in various MANET scenarios.",,,

A Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Dynamic Job Scheduling Problem,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9955328/,"Scheduling or day-ahead planning improves the efficiency of a process and often leads to other advantages such as energy savings and increased revenue. However, most real-world scheduling problems are very complicated and are usually affected by several external parameters. Hence, finding the best schedule given a set of jobs requires extensive calculations that increase exponentially with the number of jobs. Traditional schedulers are, at times, unable to address uncertainties in the system. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning approach for solving the Job Scheduling Problem in a dynamic environment with an aim to minimize the peak instantaneous electricity consumption. The training instance is randomly reset after a certain period and the solver uses online training to adapt to the new environment. Simulation results show that both the proposed approach and a Genetic Algorithm-based approach achieve the minimum peak power consumption possible, which is 58% less than on-demand dispatch. Also, for 82.2% of the simulations, our method finds a better schedule than its initialization.",,,

Congestion-aware Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction for Collision Avoidance,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560994/,"Predicting agents’ future trajectories plays a crucial role in modern AI systems, yet it is challenging due to intricate interactions exhibited in multi-agent systems, especially when it comes to collision avoidance. To address this challenge, we propose to learn congestion patterns as contextual cues explicitly and devise a novel ""Sense–Learn–Reason–Predict"" framework by exploiting advantages of three different doctrines of thought, which yields the following desirable benefits: (i) Representing congestion as contextual cues via latent factors subsumes the concept of social force commonly used in physics- based approaches and implicitly encodes the distance as a cost, similar to the way a planning-based method models the environment. (ii) By decomposing the learning phases into two stages, a ""student"" can learn contextual cues from a ""teacher"" while generating collision-free trajectories. To make the framework computationally tractable, we formulate it as an optimization problem and derive an upper bound by leveraging the variational parametrization. In experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generate collision- free trajectory predictions in a synthetic dataset designed for collision avoidance evaluation and remains competitive on the commonly used NGSIM US-101 highway dataset. Source code and dataset tools can be accessed via Github.",,,
Scalable and Autonomous Network Defense Using Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570419/,"An autonomous network defense method under attack is a critical part of preventing network infrastructure from potential damage in real time. Despite various network intrusion detection techniques, our network space is not safe enough due to the increasing exploitation of software vulnerabilities. Thus, timely response and defense methods under network intrusion are important techniques given the large scope of cyberattacks in recent years. In this paper, we design a scalable and autonomous network defense method by using the model of a zero-sum Markov game between an attacker and a defender agent. To scale up the proposed defense model, we utilize a graph convolutional network (GCN) along with framestacking to address the partial observability of the environment. The agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) which allows for good convergence in a reasonable timeframe.

Multiteacher Multifeature Knowledge Distillation Based on Dynamic Mutual Selection,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902628/,"Multiteacher knowledge distillation methods exhibit superior adaptability and flexibility over single-teacher models when handling diverse datasets. However, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with varying feature types and different numbers of teacher models. The first challenge lies in selecting the optimal distillation samples for the student model, and the second involves choosing the most appropriate teacher model for specific feature types. To address these challenges, we propose a multiteacher multifeature knowledge distillation learning framework based on dynamic mutual selection (DMS-MTMF). DMS-MTMF employs a dynamic mutual selection module search for the optimal combination of teacher models and features, ensuring a harmonious collaboration that yields superior training outcomes. During this process, selection mismatches may arise between teacher models and features. To address this, we adopt the multiagent depth determination policy gradient algorithm for collaborative optimization within the mutual selection module. Finally, a dynamic sample selection module is proposed to model the sample selection cost. DMS-MTMF eliminates the distortion caused by static distillation sample selection. Experimental results on the HHU and PU datasets not only highlight the importance of dynamic mutual selection and sample selection but also achieve higher accuracy than other comparative methods.",,,

Multiassistant Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Decreasing Threshold Channel Pruning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323328/,"Bearing fault detection and classification under a diagnostics model with fewer parameters has been a challenging problem. A common solution is knowledge distillation (KD) using teacher–student models. Through the distillation process, the student model can acquire knowledge from the teacher model to enhance performance without introducing extra parameters. However, when using a powerful teacher model, distillation performance is not always ideal. This is because a more powerful teacher model can generate more specific classification strategies, which may result in poorer distillation performance. To this end, the multiassistant KD (MAKD) method is proposed, which bridges the gap between the teacher–student models by incorporating several intermediate-sized assistant models (AMs). Moreover, these AMs have the same architecture, which creates a better knowledge transfer condition at the logit layer. To further optimize the network structure to improve the distillation performance, decreasing threshold channel pruning (DTCP) is proposed to generate better AMs. DTCP leverages the scatter value of the decreasing function to prune the channels of the teacher model, which retains more channels that are beneficial to distillation. Finally, four-class and ten-class classification experiments are conducted on two bearing datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DTCP-MAKD method improves distillation performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art KD methods.",,,

A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning-Based Model for the Vehicle Routing Problem in Transportation Logistics,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9631282/,"Currently, the number of deliveries handled by transportation logistics is rapidly increasing because of the significant growth of the e-commerce industry, resulting in the need for improved functional vehicle routing measures for logistic companies. The effective management of vehicle routing helps companies reduce operational costs and increases its competitiveness. The vehicle routing problem (VRP) seeks to identify optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to customers while simultaneously considering changing requirements and uncertainties in the transportation environment. Due to its combinatorial nature and complexity, conventional optimization approaches may not be practical to solve VRP. In this paper, a new optimization model based on reinforcement learning (RL) and a complementary tree-based regression method is proposed. In our proposed model, when the RL agent performs vehicle routing optimization, its state and action are fed into the tree-based regression model to assess whether the current route is feasible according to the given environment, and the response received is used by the RL agent to adjust actions for optimizing the vehicle routing task. The procedure repeats iteratively until the maximum iteration is reached, then the optimal vehicle route is returned and can be utilized to assist in decision making. Multiple logistics agency case studies are conducted to demonstrate the application and practicality of the proposed model.

Remote Driving Control With Real-Time Video Streaming Over Wireless Networks: Design and Evaluation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9797698/,"There is a large gap between current AI-based autonomous-driving cars and fully autonomous cars, where the remote control of vehicles can be a unique solution to fill the gap. The remote control enables valuable operational data to be obtained, thus laying the groundwork for gradually increasing autonomous driving performance in the future. Moreover, human assistance through remote driving can offer more flexibility and intelligence than a single artificial intelligence. However, the real-time transmission of data and images is particularly crucial for remotely driven vehicles. The latency between a vehicle and the controller depends on the video streaming communication methods and transport protocols. Furthermore, the control or driving performance also depends on the vehicle speed likewise. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of different communication methods of video streaming and vehicle “speed” on the performance of remote driving. We design a vehicle remote driving system based on ROS (Robot Operating System) with ROS as the core communication architecture to realize remote control of vehicles. The video stream is transmitted using three different streaming methods: ROS multi-computer communication, TCP protocol, and UDP protocol. To be specific, we implement a simple remote driving system for a “model” car, drive it at different speeds, and analyze how the drivers perform in terms of whether the vehicle gets off the track while driving. Based on the results, we find that “UDP-based video streaming” achieves 720P video streaming with a latency of less than 50ms, which is helpful for further research on remote driving. The experiment by “directly” observing the vehicle with eyes instead of using video streaming is also conducted to remove the video streaming latency. The experiment results show that the speed of the vehicle and the video streaming methods have a significant impact on the driving performance, and UDP protocol-based video streaming method is better suited for remote driving. The results imply that remote driving should be used in a low-speed environment rather than at high speed.",,,

We put forward the Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation (TransKD) framework which learns compact student transformers by distilling both feature maps and patch embeddings of large teacher transformers, bypassing the long pre-training process and reducing the FLOPs by >85.0%. Specifically, we propose two fundamental modules to realize feature map distillation and patch embedding distillation, respectively: 1) Cross Selective Fusion (CSF) enables knowledge transfer between cross-stage features via channel attention and feature map distillation within hierarchical transformers; 2) Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) performs dimensional transformation within the patchifying process to facilitate the patch embedding distillation. Furthermore, we introduce two optimization modules to enhance the patch embedding distillation from different perspectives: 1) Global-Local Context Mixer (GL-Mixer) extracts both global and local information of a representative embedding; 2) Embedding Assistant (EA) acts as an embedding method to seamlessly bridge teacher and student models with the teacher’s number of channels. Experiments on Cityscapes, ACDC, NYUv2, and Pascal VOC2012 datasets show that TransKD outperforms state-of-the-art distillation frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method.

ILL itself is a rediscovery and generalization of Shannon’s lattice theory of information, where probability measures are not given but are learned from training data. This article explains the basics of the ILL framework, including both how to construct a lattice-structured abstraction universe that specifies the structural possibilities of rules, and how to find the most informative rules by performing statistical learning through an iterative student–teacher algorithmic architecture that optimizes information functionals.

MKDC: A Lightweight Method for Cloud-Edge Collaborative Fault Diagnosis Model,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670016/,"Artificial intelligence has been widely applied in the field of mechanical fault diagnosis and has achieved remarkable results. Most edge-computing environments in industrial production use embedded systems, which have limited computing power. Although deep learning models for fault diagnosis are powerful, they consume significant computational resources, making them difficult to directly apply in cloud-edge collaborative fault diagnosis systems. To reduce the feedback time and deployment cost of fault diagnosis systems, this article conducts research from two aspects: optimizing measurement points and multidimensional distillation compression. This article proposes a lightweight method for a cloud-edge collaborative fault diagnosis model based on multidimensional knowledge distillation compression (MKDC). First, by optimizing the number of measurement points, the redundancy of test data is reduced. Then, based on the structure of the knowledge distillation compression model, the aim of creating a lightweight fault diagnosis network model is achieved by compressing the fault feature extraction units and fusion units. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed compression method, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement in model compression.

TalkSQL: A Tool for the Synthesis of SQL Queries from Verbal Specifications,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9334088/,"Recent advances in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to many robust user interfaces (UIs) designed as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that help students learn, query and access data in relational databases. Such tools are generally referred to as Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDBs). Many of these UIs rely on voice or typewritten for further processing. Research has shown that typewritten remains the preferred input method used by database UIs designers for querying relational databases due to its flexibility. Still, there is a dearth of tools that require voice-based inputs for querying relational databases. Despite the scarcity of these tools, many of them fail to provide a comprehensive feedback to a user. In this paper, we introduce a voice-based query system named TalkSQL that takes voice inputs from a user, converts these words into SQL queries and returns a feedback to the user. Automatic feedback generation is of immense importance. To achieve this, we have used regular expressions, a representation of regular languages for the recognition of the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations in SQL and automatically generate a feedback using pre-defined templates. A survey on 53 participants showed that 91.2% agreed that they were able to understand the CRUD command using TalkSQL. The expected contributions are in two-fold: this work may assist a special (e.g. visually impaired) learner to understand SQL queries, and show that a voice-based interface can assist users in understanding SQL queries.",,,

UniDexGrasp: Universal Robotic Dexterous Grasping via Learning Diverse Proposal Generation and Goal-Conditioned Policy,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10205189/,"In this work, we tackle the problem of learning universal robotic dexterous grasping from a point cloud observation under a table-top setting. The goal is to grasp and lift up objects in high-quality and diverse ways and generalize across hundreds of categories and even the unseen. Inspired by successful pipelines used in parallel gripper grasping, we split the task into two stages: 1) grasp proposal (pose) generation and 2) goal-conditioned grasp execution. For the first stage, we propose a novel probabilistic model of grasp pose conditioned on the point cloud observation that factorizes rotation from translation and articulation. Trained on our synthesized large-scale dexterous grasp dataset, this model enables us to sample diverse and high-quality dexterous grasp poses for the object point cloud. For the second stage, we propose to replace the motion planning used in parallel gripper grasping with a goal-conditioned grasp policy, due to the complexity involved in dexterous grasping execution. Note that it is very challenging to learn this highly generalizable grasp policy that only takes realistic inputs without oracle states. We thus propose several important innovations, including state canonicalization, object curriculum, and teacher-student distillation. In-tegrating the two stages, our final pipeline becomes the first to achieve universal generalization for dexterous grasping, demonstrating an average success rate of more than 60% on thousands of object instances, which significantly out-performs all baselines, meanwhile showing only a minimal generalization gap.",,,
Model-Free Force Control of Cable-Driven Parallel Manipulators for Weight-Shift Aircraft Actuation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373112/,"We present a novel approach to flight control of weight-shift aircraft by employing a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) integrated with adaptive force control based on reinforcement learning. Development of weight-shift aircraft control has been sparse. Despite limited but notable efforts, modeling is hindered by parameter uncertainty stemming from the system’s nonlinear dynamics. The model-free control method introduced in this work operates without relying on the knowledge of the complex dynamics inherent to weight-shift aircraft flight control. An online reinforcement learning technique known as action dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP) is applied to the problem of coordinating the tension forces across parallel cable-driven actuators. Two adaptive learning agents perform demanded weight-shift maneuvers by coordinating torque commands, without an inverse kinematics model. The online reinforcement learning control is implemented on flight controller hardware with limited computational resources and strict timing constraints, performing real-time experiments on a kinematically equivalent surrogate two-body weight-shift mechanism. After online training in the presence of sustained disturbance events, the adaptive learning agents optimally balance against competing trajectory tracking objectives. The CDPR capably reproduces standard S-turn maneuvers, coordinating simultaneous banking and pitching speed actions. The encouraging experimental results inform future integration of the weight-shift CDPRs toward automatic flight control that is unprecedented for this class of aircraft.",,,
Transfer Reinforcement Learning Aided Distributed Network Slicing Optimization in Industrial IoT,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9633170/,"With the growth of the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the emergence of new applications, satisfying distinct QoS in the same physical network becomes more challenging. Recently, with the advance of network functions virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies, the network slicing technique has emerged as a promising solution. It can divide a physical network into multiple virtual networks, therefore providing different network services. In this article, to meet distinct QoS in industrial IoT, we design a network slicing architecture over the SDN-based long-range wide area network. The SDN controller can dynamically split the network into multiple virtual networks according to different business requirements. On this basis, we proposed a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based slice optimization algorithm. It enables LoRa gateways to intelligently configure slice parameters (e.g., transmission power and spreading factor) to improve the slice performance in terms of QoS, energy efficiency, and reliability.

Accuracy Enhancement Method for Speech Emotion Recognition From Spectrogram Using Temporal Frequency Correlation and Positional Information Learning Through Knowledge Transfer,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643506/,"In this paper, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of speech emotion recognition (SER) by using vision transformer (ViT) to attend to the correlation of frequency (y-axis) with time (x-axis) in spectrogram and transferring positional information between ViT through knowledge transfer. The proposed method has the following originality i) We use vertically segmented patches of log-Mel spectrogram to analyze the correlation of frequencies over time. This type of patch allows us to correlate the most relevant frequencies for a particular emotion with the time they were uttered. ii) We propose the use of image coordinate encoding, an absolute positional encoding suitable for ViT. By normalizing the x, y coordinates of the image to −1 to 1 and concatenating them to the image, we can effectively provide valid absolute positional information for ViT. iii) Through feature map matching, the locality and location information of the teacher network is effectively transmitted to the student network. Teacher network is a ViT that contains locality of convolutional stem and absolute position information through image coordinate encoding, and student network is a structure that lacks positional encoding in the basic ViT structure. In feature map matching stage, we train through the mean absolute error (L1 loss) to minimize the difference between the feature maps of the two networks. To validate the proposed method, three emotion datasets (SAVEE, EmoDB, and CREMA-D) consisting of speech were converted into log-Mel spectrograms for comparison experiments. As a result of the experiment, the proposed method achieved 99.47%, 99.76%, and 95.24% accuracy, significantly exceeding the state-of-the-art methods, with much less computational complexity on three emotion datasets.",,,

DNFS-VNE: Deep Neuro Fuzzy System Driven Virtual Network Embedding,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787254/,"By decoupling substrate resources, network virtualization (NV) is a promising solution for meeting diverse demands and ensuring differentiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, virtual network embedding (VNE) is a critical enabling technology that enhances the flexibility and scalability of network deployment by addressing the coupling of Internet processes and services. However, in the existing deep neural networks (DNNs)-based works, the closed-box nature DNNs limits the analysis, development, and improvement of systems. For example, in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a conflict between decision interpretability and the opacity of DNN-based methods. In recent times, interpretable deep learning (DL) represented by deep neuro fuzzy systems (DNFSs) combined with fuzzy inference has shown promising interpretability to further exploit the hidden value in the data. Motivated by this, we propose a DNFS-based VNE algorithm that aims to provide an interpretable NV scheme. Specifically, data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as fuzzy implication operators to compute the embedding probabilities of candidate substrate nodes through entailment operations. And, the identified fuzzy rule patterns are cached into the weights by forward computation and gradient back-propagation (BP). Moreover, the fuzzy rule base is constructed based on Mamdani-type linguistic rules using linguistic labels. In addition, the DNFS-driven five-block structure-based policy network serves as the agent for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which optimizes VNE decision making through interaction with the environment. Finally, the effectiveness of evaluation indicators and fuzzy rules is verified by simulation experiments.",,,

This integrated approach ensures anatomically consistent labels at scale, even for challenging, in-the-wild images. We further introduce SpinePose, extending state-of-the-art body pose estimators using knowledge distillation and an anatomical regularization strategy to jointly predict body and spine key-points.

Automatic syntax mistake detection is essential for this improvement. This research presents GED-HCA, which stands for ""Grammatical Error Detection with Hierarchical Convolutional Attention""a novel CNN-based model that combines multiple change filters with attention mechanisms. To capture local and universal syntax, the model processes the input text through parallel writing and word-state embeddings. By using shallow convolutions, the model can capture localized syntax, and by utilizing deep convolutional branching, it can generalize across more extensive language forms. Writing patterns and word-state data are both captured simultaneously by the GED-HCA algorithm, which may assist it in identifying regions of student-generated text that are prone to include mistakes. The GED-HCA gets an F1 score of 87.3% by preserving its efficiency for real-time feedback.

Scheduled Curiosity-Deep Dyna-Q: Efficient Exploration for Dialog Policy Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468605/,"Training task-oriented dialog agents based on reinforcement learning is time-consuming and requires a large number of interactions with real users. How to grasp dialog policy within limited dialog experiences remains an obstacle that makes the agent training process less efficient. In addition, most previous frameworks start training by randomly choosing training samples, which differs from the human learning method and hurts the efficiency and stability of training. Therefore, we propose Scheduled Curiosity-Deep Dyna-Q (SC-DDQ), a curiosity-driven curriculum learning framework based on a state-of- the-art model-based reinforcement learning dialog model, Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ). Furthermore, we design ed learning schedules for SC-DDQ and DDQ, respectively, following two opposite training strategies: classic curriculum learning and its reverse version. Our results show that by introducing scheduled learning and curiosity, the new framework leads to a significant improvement over the DDQ and Deep Q-learning (DQN). Surprisingly, we found that traditional curriculum learning was not always effective. Specifically, according to the experimental results, the easy-first and difficult-first strategies are more suitable for SC-DDQ and DDQ.

In our work, we develop a multilingual talkbot that converses among learners in both English & Arabic using Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. The dialog bot was created in Python & is intended for use by students to answer questions about advice. We utilizing a intent built domain-specific compilation as the knowledge source for the talkbots, which is made up of the typical queries students ask advisers & their answers. By analysing the inputs, the talktbot engine ascertains the client's needs and, with an efficiency of 80.00 % in English and 75.00 % in Arabic, finds the most reasonable answer that meets the intention. We also tested the software solution as well as the talkbot's precision using field tests with pupils to see how well it responded to live input.",,,
PartManip: Learning Cross-Category Generalizable Part Manipulation Policy from Point Cloud Observations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203221/,"Learning a generalizable object manipulation policy is vital for an embodied agent to work in complex real-world scenes. Parts, as the shared components in different object categories, have the potential to increase the generalization ability of the manipulation policy and achieve cross-category object manipulation. In this work, we build the first large-scale, part-based cross-category object manipulation benchmark, PartManip, which is composed of 11 object categories, 494 objects, and 1432 tasks in 6 task classes. Compared to previous work, our benchmark is also more diverse and realistic, i.e., having more objects and using sparse-view point cloud as input without oracle information like part segmentation. To tackle the difficulties of vision-based policy learning, we first train a statebased expert with our proposed part-based canonicalization and part-aware rewards, and then distill the knowledge to a vision-based student. We also find an expressive backbone is essential to overcome the large diversity of different objects. For cross-category generalization, we introduce domain adversarial learning for domain-invariant feature extraction. Extensive experiments in simulation show that our learned policy can outperform other methods by a large margin, especially on unseen object categories. We also demonstrate our method can successfully manipulate novel objects in the real world. Our benchmark has been released in https://pku-epic.github.io/PartManip.",,,

Enabling Remote Human-to-Machine Applications With AI-Enhanced Servers Over Access Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139304/,"The recent research trends for achieving ultra-reliable and low-latency communication networks are largely driven by smart manufacturing and industrial Internet-of-Things applications. Such applications are being realized through Tactile Internet that allows users to control remote things and involve the bidirectional transmission of video, audio, and haptic data. However, the end-to-end propagation latency presents a stubborn bottleneck, which can be alleviated by using various artificial intelligence-based application layer and network layer prediction algorithms, e.g., forecasting and preempting haptic feedback transmission. In this paper, we study the experimental data on traffic characteristics of control signals and haptic feedback samples obtained through virtual reality-based human-to-machine teleoperation. Moreover, we propose the installation of edge-intelligence servers between master and slave devices to implement the preemption of haptic feedback from control signals. Harnessing virtual reality-based teleoperation experiments, we further propose a two-stage artificial intelligence-based module for forecasting haptic feedback samples. The first-stage unit is a supervised binary classifier that detects if haptic sample forecasting is necessary and the second-stage unit is a reinforcement learning unit that ensures haptic feedback samples are forecasted accurately when different types of material are present. Furthermore, by evaluating analytical expressions, we show the feasibility of deploying remote human-to-machine teleoperation over fiber backhaul by using our proposed artificial intelligence-based module, even under heavy traffic intensity.",,,

Facial Expression Recognition with Vision Transformers for Intelligent Engagement Monitoring in English Classroom,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11034960/,"For better learning outcomes and teaching efficacy in today's schools, it is essential to comprehend student engagement and emotional reactions. Conventional teaching evaluation techniques frequently depend on subjective observation and delayed feedback, which might not fully capture students' in-the-moment learning experiences.

Fast Retinomorphic Event-Driven Representations for Video Gameplay and Action Recognition,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8878127/,"Good temporal representations are crucial for video understanding, and the state-of-the-art video recognition framework is based on two-stream networks. In such framework, besides the regular ConvNets responsible for RGB frame inputs, a second network is introduced to handle the temporal representation, usually the optical flow (OF). However, OF or other task-oriented flow is computationally costly, and is thus typically pre-computed. Critically, this prevents the two-stream approach from being applied to reinforcement learning (RL) applications such as video game playing, where the next state depends on current state and action choices. Inspired by the early vision systems of mammals and insects, we propose a fast event-driven representation (EDR) that models several major properties of early retinal circuits: (1) logarithmic input response, (2) multi-timescale temporal smoothing to filter noise, and (3) bipolar (ON/OFF) pathways for primitive event detection. Trading off the directional information for fast speed (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$>$</tex-math></inline-formula>9000 fps), EDR enables fast real-time inference/learning in video applications that require interaction between an agent and the world such as game-playing, virtual robotics, and domain adaptation. In this vein, we use EDR to demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms for Atari games, something that has not been possible with pre-computed OF.

Optimizing Reinforcement Learning-Based Visual Navigation for Resource-Constrained Devices,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278417/,"Existing work on Deep reinforcement learning-based visual navigation mainly focuses on autonomous agents with ample power and compute resources. However, Reinforcement learning for visual navigation on resource-constrained devices remains an under-explored area of research, primarily due to challenges posed by processing high-dimensional visual inputs and making prompt decisions in realtime scenarios. To address these hurdles, we propose a State Abstraction Technique (SAT) designed to transform high-dimensional visual inputs into a compact representation, enabling simpler reinforcement learning agents to process the information and learn effective navigation policies. The abstract representation generated by SAT effortlessly serves as a versatile intermediary that bridges the gap between simulation and reality, enhancing the transferability of learned policies across various scenarios. Additionally, our reward shaping strategy uses the data provided by SAT to maintain a safe distance from obstacles, further improving the performance of navigation policies on resource-constrained devices. Our work opens up opportunities for navigation assistance and other applications in a variety of resource-constrained domains, where computational efficiency is crucial for practical deployment, such as guiding miniature agents on embedded devices or aiding visually impaired individuals through smartphone-integrated solutions. Evaluation of proposed approach on the AI2-Thor simulated environment demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional state representations. The proposed method provides 84.18% fewer collisions, 28.96% fewer movement instructions and 11.3% higher rewards compared to the best alternative options available. Furthermore, we carefully account for real-world challenges by considering noise and motion blur during training, ensuring optimal performance during deployment on resource-constrained devices.",,,

Application of Image Classification Based on Improved LSTM in Internet Reading Therapy Platform,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10374125/,"Reading therapy is an effective approach for improving mental states or addressing disabilities associated with individuals’ dyslexia. In traditional approaches, this process is performed through the intervention and supervision of an expert, which incurs time and cost. However, by utilizing artificial intelligence technologies, the reading therapy process can be automated. This article focuses on presenting an internet-based automated platform for reading therapy. In this method, audio and visual features during the reading therapy are processed using deep learning techniques to identify the individual’s emotional state based on their reading status. In this state, two separate convolutional neural networks are used to describe the facial image features and speech characteristics of the individual.

The Dialog Must Go On: Improving Visual Dialog via Generative Self-Training,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203535/,"Visual dialog (VisDial) is a task of answering a sequence of questions grounded in an image, using the dialog history as context. Prior work has trained the dialog agents solely on VisDial data via supervised learning or leveraged pretraining on related vision-and-language datasets. This paper presents a semi-supervised learning approach for visually-grounded dialog, called Generative Self-Training (GST), to leverage unlabeled images on the Web. Specifically, GST first retrieves in-domain images through out-of-distribution detection and generates synthetic dialogs regarding the images via multimodal conditional text generation. GST then trains a dialog agent on the synthetic and the original Vis-Dial data. As a result, GST scales the amount of training data up to an order of magnitude that of VisDial (1.2M → 12.9M QA data). For robust training of the synthetic dialogs, we also propose perplexity-based data selection and multimodal consistency regularization. Evaluation on Vis-Dial v1.0 and v0.9 datasets shows that GST achieves new state-of-the-art results on both datasets. We further observe the robustness of GST against both visual and textual adversarial attacks. Finally, GST yields strong performance gains in the low-data regime.

Two-Way Semantic Communications Without Feedback,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400867/,"Semantic communications can significantly improve transmission efficiency, especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime. However, two-way semantic communications still remain an unexplored topic, which is a critical issue in many machine communication scenarios. Simply extending existing semantic communication systems to the two-way situation requires bidirectional information feedback during the training process, resulting in significant communication overhead. To fill this gap, we investigate a two-way semantic communication (TW-SC) system, where the information feedback can be omitted by exploiting the weight reciprocity in the transceiver. Particularly, the channel simulator and semantic transceiver are implemented on both TW-SC nodes and the channel distribution is modeled by a conditional generative adversarial network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TW-SC system performs closing to the state-of-the-art one-way semantic communication systems but requiring no feedback between the transceiver in training process.",,,

Evaluating the Correlation Between Social Robot NAO and Preschoolers' Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Skills,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016513/,"Social-emotional skills, such as recognizing, under-standing, and regulating one's emotions and those of others, along with cognitive skills like working memory, phonological aware-ness, and grapheme-phoneme correspondence, are highly valued in developing cognitive, social, and emotional competencies. During the past 10 years, there has been an increasing interest in research on social robots as teaching assistants, peers, animators, or even teachers, as numerous studies have demonstrated their beneficial impact on student social skills. The physical design and advanced capabilities of humanoid robots like SoftBank Robotics' NAO demonstrate that they represent cutting-edge technology with a wide range of functionalities, enhancing the learning experience during Child-Robot Interaction (CRI). In this work, we have designed and implemented fourteen (14) educational applications for the NAO robot, evaluating its pedagogical impact in real school settings. Specifically, nine (9) focused on emotional competencies, one (1) on social interaction and collaboration, three (3) on working memory, and one (1) on the development of phonological awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence. For validation and evaluation, qualitative research was carried out in kindergartens in Attica, involving 42 preschool-aged students (4–6 years) in pre- / post-test studies. Measurements were made through observation and discussion, using video recordings, evaluation / self-evaluation sheets, rubrics, and statistical analysis. Our results and findings show that the children exhibited high participation in communicating their emotions to NAO, or even imitating it, conveying various emotions through facial expres-sions, gestures and body language. The children adapted their emotional expression according to the activity guidelines, helping NAO by proposing solutions to emotional regulation (sadness) or collaborating to solve common problems. Finally, it appears that the NAO robot can enhance both working memory and phonological awareness.

Automated Writing Evaluation Using Sentence by Sentence Scoring Model,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10212752/,"Automated writing evaluation is the use of computer programs to assess written work and offer feedback to the writer. This process is commonly used in educational settings [1] to grade essays and give students a better understanding of their writing abilities. Existing works score specific dimensions of an essay, grammar, word choice, coherence, and others to provide targeted feedback. Also, most systems focus on evaluating the essay as a whole rather than individual sentences. Sentence-level evaluation can provide more detailed and specific feedback to the writers, which may help to improve their writing skills over time. In this work, we propose a mechanism for evaluating student essays at the sentence level. A publicly available essay dataset was collected and then evaluated manually by experts to prepare a dataset with sentence-level scores. Two models were developed: the first model is based on pre-trained models (BigBird, Longformer, and DeBERTa), and the second model is a neural network architecture based on multi-head-attention mechanisms.

Towards Embodied Neural Radiance Fields,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10748705/,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a powerful rendering approach that represents scenes implicitly.

To address this, we introduce an embodied NeRF framework that leverages the agent's embodiment to automatically collect suitable images during navigation, facilitating effective NeRF model training. Our framework incorporates a novel navigation policy that guides the agent to explore the scene region by region, generated using a scene graph aware region division method. The captured images are then used to train NeRF models for the scene. To generalize the learned navigation policy to new scenes, we employ a student-forcing learning method with carefullydesigned demonstration paths.

BERT-Based Model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Analyzing Arabic Open-Ended Survey Responses: A Case Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376061/,"Educational institutions typically gather feedback from beneficiaries through formal surveys. Offering open-ended questions allows students to express their opinions about matters that may not have been measured directly in closed-ended questions. However, responses to open-ended questions are typically overlooked due to the time and effort required. Aspect-based sentiment analysis is used to automate the process of extracting fine-grained information from texts. This study aims to 1) examine the performance of different BERT-based models for aspect term extraction for Arabic text sourced from educational institution surveys; 2) develop a system that automates the ABSA process in a way that will automatically label survey responses. An end-to-end system was developed as a case study to extract aspect terms, identify their polarity, map extracted aspects to their respective categories, and aggregate category polarity. To accomplish this, the models were evaluated using an in-house dataset. The result showed that FAST-LCF-ATEPC, a multilingual checkpoint, outperformed other models including AraBERT, MARBERT, and QARiB, in the aspect-term extraction task, with an F1 score of 0.58. Hence, it was used for aspect-term polarity classification, showing an F1 score of 0.86. Mapping aspects to their respective categories using a predefined list yielded an average F1 score of 0.98. Furthermore, the polarities of the categories were aggregated to summarize the overall polarity for each category.

IHPE: A Lightweight Hand Pose Estimation Network for Surgical Motion Capture in Medical Education,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036608/,"Currently, most medical education adopts a master-apprentice model combined with video-based instruction; however, this approach is inefficient in correcting apprentices’ mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a low-cost and accurate surgical hand pose estimation method to enhance medical education. Specifically, we design an integrated hand pose estimation (IHPE) network, which combines hand keypoint detection with deep learning-based object detection to achieve precise hand pose estimation during surgery. IHPE is constructed by employing dynamic convolution and ghost convolution to build a lightweight, yet effective backbone. By replacing traditional C2f layers with newly designed In-C2f modules, the framework generates low-cost ghost features and applies dynamically generated weights to improve feature representation while significantly reducing model complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the Hagrid public dataset and a private surgical action dataset to validate the effectiveness of IHPE. On the Hagrid dataset, IHPE achieves a precision of 86.2%, with only 2.40 M parameters and a model complexity of 6.6 floating-point operations per seconds (GFLOPs). On the private dataset, IHPE achieves a precision of 90.8%, with 2.49 M parameters and a complexity of 6.9 GFLOPs, outperforming many existing lightweight detectors. In addition, we construct IHPE-eva, a teacher-student knot-tying action evaluation system based on IHPE. IHPE-eva detects hand keypoints from video streams, reconstructs motion trajectories, evaluates the periodicity of knot-tying actions using the Fourier transform, and assesses movement smoothness via the standard deviation of acceleration.

Enhancing Mapless Trajectory Prediction Through Knowledge Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036133/,"Scene information plays a crucial role in trajectory forecasting systems for autonomous driving by providing semantic clues and constraints on potential future paths of traffic agents. Prevalent trajectory prediction techniques often take High-Definition maps (HD maps) as part of the inputs to provide scene knowledge. Although HD maps offer accurate road information, they may suffer from the high cost of annotation or restrictions of law, which limits their widespread use. Therefore, it is crucial for trajectory prediction methods to generate reliable prediction results in mapless scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the problem of improving the consistency of predicted trajectories and the scene road topology when map information is unavailable during the test phase. To achieve this, we propose a universal knowledge distillation (KD) framework. This KD framework trains a map-based teacher network on samples with annotated HD maps and subsequently transfers the knowledge to a student mapless predictor through a two-fold knowledge distillation process. Experimental results show that our method stably improves prediction performance in test-time mapless situations on many widely used trajectory prediction baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art mapless prediction performances. Qualitative visualization results demonstrate that our approach helps infer unseen map information. Our solution is generalizable for common trajectory prediction networks and datasets.",,,

A Systematic Survey on Computational agents for Mental Health Aid,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9824269/,"In recent times the rate of mental health disorders among the youth has spiked due to increased competitiveness which affects the mental well-being of students. An unhealthy mental state not only affects the daily life of an individual but is also the reason for increased self-harm and suicide rates. In developing nations, the ratio of mental care professionals to mental health patients is far too less for all to receive care. A solution to this problem is internet-delivered cognitive therapy (iCBT). The objective of this paper is to shed light on various techniques that can deliver iCBT to a patient in a comfortable manner. Since iCBT can be delivered from home, it tackles the challenge of societal stigma. Different existing approaches and solutions being implemented like various types of chatbots(SERMO, EMMA) and social robots(Ryan Bot)are analyzed and compared in this paper. We also analyze different types of existing datasets(NHS Mental Health Dataset, CounselChat Dataset, ISEAR Dataset) used to train various models(Convolutional Neural Networks, Recursive Neural Networks, Hierarchical Attention Network, Transformers).

Leader-Following Group Consensus of Fractional-Order Multiagent Systems via a Dynamic Event-Triggered Control Strategy,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328790/,"This article focuses on the problem of leader-following group consensus for a class of fractional-order multiagent systems within the undirected communication topology. With the purpose of reducing the updating frequency of the control signal, an auxiliary dynamical variable is generated to construct the dynamic event-triggering mechanism by which the triggering instants can be delicately determined for each agent to broadcast the information to its neighbors. Under the intergroup balance condition, the distributed consensus control protocols are designed by taking advantage of the related state of the agent (in each subgroup) to its neighbors and leader. By using the Lyapunov direct approach and combining it with the properties of Caputo-type calculus, some sufficient criteria are derived in an easy-to-use form for ensuring the global Mittag–Leffler stability of the consensus error system. The Zeno phenomenon is also excluded from the proposed triggering mechanism. At last, an illustrative example and its simulations are given to show the validity of the theoretical results.",,,
FRETA-D: A Toolkit of Automatic Annotation of Grammatical and Phonetic Error Types in French Dictations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10016326/,"Dictation is considered as an efficient practice for testing French as a Foreign Language (FFL) learners’ language proficiency. However, in-class dictation and teachers’ manual correction greatly reduce teaching efficiency. An existing dictation platform can only partly resolve these problems by providing instant error correction. To pursue better pedagogical feedback, this study develops an annotation toolkit called FRETA-D (FRench Error Type Annotation for Dictation), with an aim to provide more detailed error-type information for both FFL students and teachers. With parallel “learner input - reference text” sentences as input, FRETA-D can automatically identify error boundaries as well as classify and annotate the errors into fine-grained error types. Designed especially for French dictation, FRETA-D features a data-set-independent classifier based on a framework with 25 main error types, which is generated from French grammar rules and incorporates the characteristics of FFL learners’ common dictation errors.

MathVision: An Accessible Intelligent Agent for Visually Impaired People to Understand Mathematical Equations,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787000/,"2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from some form of vision impairment, according to the World Health Organization. Children with vision impairment and visual impairment may experience impaired physical, linguistic, and cognitive development, resulting in reduced levels of academic accomplishment. Many visually impaired people are working in the education sector whether they are students or teachers. Without external assistance reading of mathematical equations in images for visually impaired people is very challenging due to the complexity of notations, symbols, and variables. This paper presents a model named MathVision which converts the mathematical equation into voice. This voice is quite helpful for visually impaired people to understand mathematical equations. The proposed model is comprised of YOLOv7 object detection architecture to detect and categorize mathematical equations inside images into four distinct types: limits, trigonometry, integration, and an additional category. The input image is divided into a grid by the YOLOv7 model, and each grid cell is responsible for finding equations that fall into its respective category. bounding box coordinates, object labels, and probability scores are predicted for each equation. In the next stage, a fine-tuned DenseNet is utilized for detailed feature extraction from mathematical equation images. This involves optimizing a pre-trained DenseNet model to capture intricate patterns specific to equations. The fine-tuned DenseNet enhances overall accuracy in equation detection and categorization within the system. In the subsequent phase, an attention mechanism-based LSTM network is employed to generate natural language descriptions for mathematical equations. During the decoding process, the model is better able to focus on pertinent portions of the equation due to the integration of attention. The LSTM architecture, chosen for its effectiveness with sequential data, is trained on a dataset containing paired examples of equations and corresponding human-generated descriptions. Fine-tuning includes optimizing hyperparameters for the task, and evaluation metrics such as the BLEU score are used to assess the model’s performance in generating accurate and contextually relevant textual representations for the detected mathematical content. Our text-to-speech system takes input in the form of a natural language sentence generated by the LSTM model and converts it to the voice. This TTS using natural language processing analyzes and processes the text then it converts this processed text into speech using digital signal processing technology. A platform-independent pyttsx3 python library is used for converting text into speech. It also works offline which is the main reason for using this library in this research work. As there was no dataset available of mathematical equations with their natural language description, we created a custom dataset. We conducted real-world experiments in various visually impaired schools to see whether visually impaired students can understand mathematical equations by hearing the voice. These experiments prove that the MathVision Model is an efficient way for visually impaired students to read and write mathematical equations by listening to the voice of equations generated by proposed model.INDEX TERMS Mathematical equations, fine-tuned, YOLO v7, convolution neural network, attention mechanism, long short term memory, neural text to speech, technological development.",,,
A Qualitative Analysis of Interaction Techniques in a Virtual Reality Instruction Environment: Experiences From a Case Study,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024471/,"As they can immerse people into virtual worlds free from external distraction, virtual reality (VR) applications are an important factor in research today and can be useful in various scenarios such as intervention training, simulations and in learning environments. However, many people are not used to interacting and navigating in VR and may not have much prior technical experience, which can become a distracting factor to the content and can influence success negatively. Thus, benefits of VR-environments cannot be fully exploited. Aiming to counteract the problem that people cannot take advantage of the benefits of VR-applications, an instruction room for training representative interaction patterns, i.e. interaction and locomotion mechanics, was designed. Students (N = 12) were videotaped going through six stations of the instruction room with different interaction tasks. They were prompted to think aloud to capture their thoughts (e.g., intuitiveness, usability and expansion ideas) while interacting, and interviewed afterwards for an overall assessment.

Toward Mitigating Sex Bias in Pilot Trainees' Stress and Fatigue Modeling,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10780736/,"While researchers have been trying to understand the stress and fatigue among pilots, especially pilot trainees, and to develop stress/fatigue models to automate the process of detecting stress/fatigue, they often do not consider biases such as sex in those models. However, in a critical profession like aviation, where the demographic distribution is disproportionately skewed to one sex, it is urgent to mitigate biases for fair and safe model predictions. In this work, we investigate the perceived stress/fatigue of 69 college students, including 40 pilot trainees with around 63% male. We construct models with decision trees first without bias mitigation and then with bias mitigation using a threshold optimizer with demographic parity and equalized odds constraints 30 times with random instances. Using bias mitigation, we achieve improvements of 88.31% (demographic parity difference) and 54.26% (equalized odds difference), which are also found to be statistically significant.",,,

MoFlow: One-Step Flow Matching for Human Trajectory Forecasting via Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation based Distillation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095073/,"In this paper, we address the problem of human trajectory forecasting, which aims to predict the inherently multi-modal future movements of humans based on their past trajectories and other contextual cues. We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the K sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all K sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance.

GNN-Aided Distributed GAN with Partially Observable Social Graph,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570928/,"The proliferation of edge computing has facilitated the edge-based artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) for ubiquitous and distributed end devices. To exemplify, we focus on the distributed implementation of one established instance, generative adversarial network (GAN), yielding the distributed GAN task. Practically speaking, this task usually is impeded by concerns including the unknown latency (of processing and transmission), the fairness requirement induced by heterogeneous distributed data and the limited energy budget of end devices. Besides, an often neglected factor is how to exploit feedback from networked end devices among which social ties indicate the flow of shared information. In practice, such social ties are partially observable to lack of exact knowledge of users, e.g., resulted from scarce historical data and privacy issues. Under this setting, we propose an online algorithm via integration of 1) online learning aided by graph neural network (GNN), aiming to recover social ties with GNN-based edge prediction, for accelerated learning of uncertainty and 2) online control to adaptively guarantee the constraints. We theoretically show that it not only achieves a sub-linear regret with guaranteed energy consumption and fairness but also leads to a superior global GAN.

Robust Aerial Person Detection With Lightweight Distillation Network for Edge Deployment,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10578033/,"Aerial person detection (APD) is vital for enhancing search and rescue (SaR) operations, particularly when locating victims in remote, poorly-lit areas. Despite advancements in detection technologies, achieving a balance between detection speed and accuracy on mobile devices in “edge AI” continues to pose challenges. In this article, a lightweight distillation network (APDNet) is proposed for edge deployment of APD, which enables real-time inference as well as minimizes accuracy loss during model transfer. The proposed APDNet employs a distillation network between varying-depth backbones and integrates an 8-bit quantized optimizer to reduce the floating-point operations of network parameters. Specifically, in the teach-assistant distillation (TAD) stage, small student models using random weight initialization are trained with pseudo-labels generated by deeper teacher models, facilitating consistent learning for a more accurate, lighter model. Moreover, a low-precision quantization (LPQ) stage incorporates an offline, quantization-aware training strategy that dynamically adjusts the ranges of weight and activation function float-point values, reducing computational complexity. In order to compensate for the potential accuracy decline, a pluggable tracker updates the position and feature information of persons frame-by-frame, with tracking results integrated with detection outputs to enhance accuracy.

As a crucial element of IoRT, mission-critical applications, such as industrial manufacturing and emergency services, impose stringent requirements on ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). The paper focuses on addressing URLLC challenges in the context of IoRT, particularly when autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) coexist with static sensors. We prioritize safe and efficient AMRs’ travel through trajectory design and communication resource allocation in IoRT systems without the need of any prior knowledge. To enhance network connectivity and exploit diversity gains, we introduce the flexible decoding and free clustering as the next-generation multiple access technologies in spectrum-limited downlink IoRT system. Then, aiming at minimizing the decoding error probability and travel time, we formulate a long-term multi-objective optimization problem by jointly designing AMRs’ trajectory and communication resource. To accommodate the inherent dynamics and unpredictability in the IoRT system, we introduce a multi-agent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, offering four distinct implementations, each accompanied by comprehensive complexity analyses.

This book will help academics, researchers, developers, graduate and undergraduate students to comprehend complex SP data across a wide range of topical application areas such as social multimedia data collected from social media networks, medical imaging data, data from Covid tests etc. This book focuses on AI utilization in the speech, image, communications and yirtual reality domains.",,,
Design and Optimization of an Assistive Cane With Visual Odometry for Blind People to Detect Obstacles With Hollow Section,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548934/,"Existing obstacle avoidance systems do not consider the situation of hollowed-out obstacles. Therefore, in this paper, we design an assistive cane with visual odometry based on these requirements of the blind to aid them in attaining safe indoor navigation. The proposed device is portable, compact and adaptable. The assistive cane with visual odometry can be used not only to directly detect obstacles, but also to draw the attention of people around, providing multiple protection for the blind. In order to optimize the device parameters, we select the height of the camera and the speed of the voice broadcast as factors to design a complete factorial design, aiming to explore the parameter level that can make the passing time shortest and the success rate of obstacle avoidance highest. We invited two visually impaired people and two blindfolded students with normal vision as the experimental subjects. Each subject was required to conduct the experiments under nine combinations of device parameters. The subjects tried to avoid obstacles according to the voice prompts. The passing time and the success rate of obstacle avoidance were recorded. The experimental results show that the broadcast speed causes the significant effect to the success rate and both the two factors affect the passing time. In addition, we discuss the results of different subjects’ response surfaces and perceptual patterns and get the conclusion that different visual perceptual patterns, namely route representation and two different survey representations, have a certain impact on the setting of the optimal parameter level and the optimal passing time. The congenitally blind subject with route representation has the shortest optimal passing time in an unfamiliar environment, and the camera height should be set at the center of the hollowed-out obstacle, while the results are somewhat different for the acquired visual impairment subjects and the blindfolded normal vision subjects with survey representation. The camera height should be set between the center and the upper position of the obstacle. In summary, the camera height should be set at the center of the hollowed-out barrier and the broadcast speed should be set at the highest level. At the same time, the device parameters should be adjusted appropriately according to the visual perception pattern of users. Further researches are needed to analyze the perceptual patterns in depth.",,,
SoundSignature: What Type of Music do you Like?,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704174/,"SoundSignature is a music application that integrates a custom OpenAI Assistant to analyze users' favorite songs. The system incorporates state-of-the-art Music Information Retrieval (MIR) Python packages to combine extracted acoustic/musical features with the assistant's extensive knowledge of the artists and bands. Capitalizing on this combined knowledge, SoundSignature leverages semantic audio and principles from the emerging Internet of Sounds (IoS) ecosystem, integrating MIR with AI to provide users with personalized insights into the acoustic properties of their music, akin to a musical preference personality report. Users can then interact with the chatbot to explore deeper inquiries about the acoustic analyses performed and how they relate to their musical taste. This interactivity transforms the application, acting not only as an informative resource about familiar and/or favorite songs, but also as an educational platform that enables users to deepen their understanding of musical features, music theory, acoustic properties commonly used in signal processing, and the artists behind the music. Beyond general usability, the application also incorporates several well-established open-source musician-specific tools, such as a chord recognition algorithm (CREMA), a source separation algorithm (DEMUCS), and an audio-to-MIDI converter (basic-pitch). These features allow users without coding skills to access advanced, open-source music processing algorithms simply by interacting with the chatbot (e.g., can you give me the stems of this song?). In this paper, we highlight the application's innovative features and educational potential, and present findings from a pilot user study that evaluates its efficacy and usability.",,,
AdaNIC: Towards Practical Neural Image Compression via Dynamic Transform Routing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10377997/,"Compressive autoencoders (CAEs) play an important role in deep learning-based image compression, but large-scale CAEs are computationally expensive. We propose a framework with three techniques to enable efficient CAE-based image coding: 1) Spatially-adaptive convolution and normalization operators enable block-wise nonlinear transform to spend FLOPs unevenly across the image to be compressed, according to a transform capacity map. 2) Just-unpenalized model capacity (JUMC) optimizes the transform capacity of each CAE block via rate-distortion-complexity optimization, finding the optimal capacity for the source image content. 3) A lightweight routing agent model predicts the transform capacity map for the CAEs by approximating JUMC targets. By activating the best-sized sub-CAE inside the slimmable supernet, our approach achieves up to 40% computational speed-up with minimal BD-Rate increase, validating its ability to save computational resources in a content-aware manner.",,,
Field-Tested: Usability Insights from a Mobile VSEE Application,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131916/,"Visual Soil Examination and Evaluation (VSEE) techniques allow farmers to assess the health and thus the growth potential of farmland. We created a prototype mobile application to support VSEE, and this study presents its design and evaluation. The usability testing was conducted in real conditions during a field day at a teaching farm with 13 stakeholders, including farmers, educators, researchers, and students. Usability was assessed using the Positive System Usability Scale (P-SUS), yielding a score of 69, which hints at above-average usability. In addition to formal usability testing, informal feedback provided more insights. Many users suggested incorporating AI-based machine vision to automate VSEE tasks. While intriguing, this suggestion reflects common misconceptions about the current capabilities of AI. Users also compared the app to its paper counterpart, with many preferring information on an A4 sheet as opposed to a mobile device. Some critique was given to the app's design, which was consciously tailored for the challenging farm conditions, resulting in minimalist UI and navigation. However, this tailored approach may have confused users who are accustomed to more complex interfaces. It is possible that while the minimalist design suited field use, it negatively impacted usability by deviating from familiar conventions. Our experiences emphasize the need for balancing usability with use-case-specific design in agricultural technology, while also addressing user expectations and misconceptions.",,,
